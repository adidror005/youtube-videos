Anan Ashraf,"<p><strong>Future Fund&nbsp;</strong>Managing Partner&nbsp;<strong>Gary Black</strong> believes <strong>Tesla Inc</strong> (NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ"">TSLA</a>) CEO <strong>Elon Musk</strong>&#8216;s 2018 compensation package will likely be overwhelmingly <a href=""https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/04/38288360/breaking-tesla-shareholders-to-vote-again-on-ceo-elon-musks-voided-47b-pay-package"">approved by shareholders</a> in the upcoming annual meeting, rendering a &#8220;huge positive&#8221; to the company.</p>



<p><strong>What Happened:</strong> Black is of the opinion that the annual shareholder meeting expected to be held on June 13, 2024, at 3:30 p.m. Central Time (CT) will be the next &#8220;major catalyst&#8221; for the company.</p>



<p>Once Musk&#8217;s rescinded 2018 compensation package is restored by the vote of shareholders, it would eliminate the possibility of the CEO leaving, thereby rendering a &#8220;huge positive&#8221; for the company, he said in a post on social media platform <strong>X</strong>, formerly <strong>Twitter</strong>.</p>



<p>Currently, while Tesla continues to ramp efforts and achievements in the direction of autonomous driving, earnings estimates are low owing to price cuts and falling delivery estimates, he said. Black holds a price target of $200 for Tesla.</p>

<p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Black is not the only one looking forward to the meeting. In a note earlier this month, <strong>Morgan Stanley&nbsp;</strong>analyst&nbsp;<strong>Adam Jonas</strong> said that the upcoming meeting will drive material volatility in the stock and determine the <a href=""https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/05/38774504/tesla-analyst-sees-annual-shareholder-meeting-as-key-to-determining-elon-musk-led-c"">company's long-term strategic direction</a>.</p>



<p>Musk&#8217;s 2018&nbsp;pay package was rescinded by a Delaware court earlier this year after deeming it an ""unfathomable sum."" The stock-based pay package was worth $56 billion at the time of award. </p>



<p>Tesla&#8217;s board is trying to have it reinstated by a shareholder vote yet again in June, including by <a href=""https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-ratings/analyst-color/24/05/38814489/tesla-spends-on-musks-pay-vote-ads-but-ross-gerber-feels-ev-giant-could-advertise-w"">investing in advertisements</a> to the effect. </p>



<p><strong>Price Action:</strong> Tesla shares closed 1.5% higher on Friday at $177.46, according to <a href=""https://pro.benzinga.com/dashboard"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">Benzinga Pro</a>.</p>

Anusuya Lahiri,"<p>This past week, eight companies in&nbsp;<strong>KeyBanc&nbsp;</strong>analyst John Vinh&#8217;s semi-coverage universe reported, from which he highlighted vital takeaways. The companies included&nbsp;<strong>Advanced Micro Devices, Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMD#NASDAQ"">AMD</a>),&nbsp;<strong>Lattice Semiconductor Corp</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/LSCC#NASDAQ"">LSCC</a>),&nbsp;<strong>Monolithic Power Systems, Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MPWR#NASDAQ"">MPWR</a>),&nbsp;<strong>NXP Semiconductors NV</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/NXPI#NASDAQ"">NXPI</a>),&nbsp;<strong>ON Semiconductor Corp</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ON#NASDAQ"">ON</a>),&nbsp;<strong>Qualcomm Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/QCOM#NASDAQ"">QCOM</a>),&nbsp;<strong>Qorvo, Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/QRVO#NASDAQ"">QRVO</a>), and&nbsp;<strong>Skyworks Solutions, Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SWKS#NASDAQ"">SWKS</a>).</p>



<p>He noted analog cyclical semis show incremental signs of stabilization and bottoming, with booking trends improving and channel inventory further decreasing.</p>



<p>Distributors&nbsp;<strong>Arrow Electronics, Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NYSE:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ARW#NYSE"">ARW</a>) and&nbsp;<strong>Avnet, Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AVT#NASDAQ"">AVT</a>) indicate that transportation in NA, A&amp;D in EUR, datacenter, and consumer in Asia showed signs of green shoots; however, guidance reflects incremental softness on more aggressive customer destocking trends.</p>



<p>Automotive is correcting, but&nbsp;with the exception of&nbsp;<strong>Tesla, Inc.&nbsp;</strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TSLA#NASDAQ"">TSLA</a>)&nbsp;is&nbsp;not as bad as feared, while&nbsp;industrial appears further through the destocking process with indications of green shoots.</p>



<p>AI data centers remain robust, and traditional demand is gradually recovering, evidenced by new CPU platform ramps.</p>



<p>In conjunction with&nbsp;<strong>Apple Inc&#8217;s&nbsp;</strong>(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AAPL#NASDAQ"">AAPL</a>) results and outlook, iPhone demand is mainly in line, with China&#8217;s better-than-feared and emerging market strength offsetting softer mature markets in RoW.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, high-end Android demand remains strong, while the mass market segment is weak.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking into this week, Vinh has five companies scheduled to report. The companies include&nbsp;<strong>Arm Holdings Plc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/ARM#NASDAQ"">ARM</a>),&nbsp;<strong>Cirrus Logic, Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/CRUS#NASDAQ"">CRUS</a>),&nbsp;<strong>Indie Semiconductor, Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/INDI#NASDAQ"">INDI</a>),&nbsp;<strong>Microchip Technology Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MCHP#NASDAQ"">MCHP</a>), and&nbsp;<strong>Synaptics Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SYNA#NASDAQ"">SYNA</a>).&nbsp;</p>



<p>He expects solid results for ARM and CRUS for the mobile and consumer supply chain.&nbsp;CRUS&#8217;s guidance could see modest risk due to high AAPL exposure, and ARM&nbsp;should&nbsp;benefit additionally&nbsp;from continuous share gains in cloud and AI licensing momentum and healthy demand for high-end handsets.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For SYNA, the analyst will seek in-line results and in-line slightly lower guidance, with lingering enterprise softness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On analog, Vinh expects solid results and guidance for MCHP, similar to NXPI and&nbsp;<strong>Texas Instruments Inc</strong>&nbsp;(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/TXN#NASDAQ"">TXN</a>), with booking trends stabilizing and inventory normalizing further.&nbsp;</p>



<p>For Indie Semiconductor, Vinh projects in-line results and modest risks to guidance due to incremental auto weakness across both Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) Vehicle and Electric Vehicle (EV) (outside China).</p>

<p><strong>What Happened</strong>: Gerber, in an interview with CNBC&#8217;s Last Call, stated, &#8220;I&#8217;m super grateful for Tesla as an investment.&#8221; He added, &#8220;For me, it&#8217;s not whether he deserves it or not.

<p>The shareholders are set to vote on the reinstatement of Musk&#8217;s $56 billion pay package. This comes after the board invalidated Musk&#8217;s previous $47 billion pay package, <a href=""https://www.benzinga.com/news/24/04/38288360/breaking-tesla-shareholders-to-vote-again-on-ceo-elon-musks-voided-47b-pay-package"">leading to a re-vote</a>. The new vote is set to take place on May 7.</p>



<p>On Feb. 13, Ross Gerber's investment firm, Gerber Kawasaki Wealth &amp; Investment Management, reported owning 377,918 shares of Tesla, which is a 5.09% decrease from their previous ownership, <a href=""https://fintel.io/so/us/tsla/gerber-kawasaki-wealth-investment-management"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noreferrer noopener"">according</a> to Fintel.</p>

<p><strong>Why It Matters</strong>: The shareholders&#8217; vote on Musk&#8217;s pay package is a significant event for Tesla, especially considering the recent <a href=""https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/04/38284411/tesla-investor-ross-gerber-says-hes-skeptic-of-elon-musks-management-style-as-cybertruck-deliver"">challenges the company has faced</a>. The outcome of this vote could have a substantial impact on the company&#8217;s future and Musk&#8217;s position within it.</p>



<p>Gerber&#8217;s statement comes in the wake of his recent criticism of Musk&#8217;s management style, particularly in light of the <a href=""https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/24/04/38284411/tesla-investor-ross-gerber-says-hes-skeptic-of-elon-musks-management-style-as-cybertruck-deliver"">Cybertruck delivery delays</a>.

Despite these concerns, Gerber&#8217;s recent statement reflects his appreciation for the returns generated by Tesla as an investment.</p>



<p>Despite the recent criticisms, Gerber&#8217;s gratitude for Tesla&#8217;s returns highlights the company&#8217;s continued financial success, which could influence the shareholders&#8217; decision on Musk&#8217;s pay package.</p>

Upwallstreet,"<p>Like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ"">META</a>), Snap Inc (NYSE:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SNAP#NYSE"">SNAP</a>) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOG#NASDAQ"">GOOG</a>)(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ"">GOOGL</a>),&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ"">AMZN</a>) reported better-than-expected quarterly results, with stronger than expected revenue being the result of the improvements on the ad business front.</p>

<h3>First Quarter Highlights</h3>

<p>In part due to its booming&nbsp;AWS division and its advertising service, Amazon reported&nbsp;revenue grew&nbsp;12.52%&nbsp;YoY to $143.3 billion,&nbsp;surpassing LSEG&rsquo;s estimate of&nbsp;$142.5 billion.&nbsp;Operating income&nbsp;far outpaced revenue growth as well as it&nbsp;soared more than 200%&nbsp;to&nbsp;$15.3 billion, which is the first&nbsp;sign that Amazon&rsquo;s cost-cutting initiatives&nbsp;and efficiency improvements are benefiting the bottom line as net income&nbsp;skyrocketed 229% YoY to&nbsp;$10.43&nbsp;billion,&nbsp;with diluted EPS amounting to&nbsp;98 cents a share, surpassing LSEG&rsquo;s estimate of&nbsp;83 cents.</p>

<p>Amazon&rsquo;s businesses are thriving, beginning with party seller services that cover commissions that Amazon collects, along with&nbsp;fulfillment, shipping fees and other charges, grew&nbsp;16%&nbsp;YoY&nbsp;to $34.5 billion.</p>

<p>AWS&nbsp;continues to grow and challenge Google and Microsoft, both the cloud and AI front.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;AWS division&nbsp;reported a&nbsp;17%&nbsp;YoY growth&nbsp;to $25 billion, surpassing StreetAccount&rsquo;s estimate of&nbsp;$24.5 billion&nbsp;and reflecting Amazon&rsquo;s strong positioning compared to its AI rivals,&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Corporation (NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ"">MSFT</a>), who secured a leadership position with its early entry and OpenAI acquisition,&nbsp;and Alphabet, with the latter finally catching up to its peers in their efforts&nbsp;to lead&nbsp;the way&nbsp;into the golden age of&nbsp;AI.</p>

<p>AWS&rsquo; actions could spell trouble for Alphabet and Microsoft as&nbsp;Jassy&nbsp;revealed&nbsp;significant investments over the next few years to build new infrastructure and data centers.&nbsp;Amazon will be&nbsp;investing&nbsp;$5.3 billion in Saudi Arabia and $5 billion in Mexico&nbsp;to&nbsp;build new infrastructure centers, along with&nbsp;$10 billion&nbsp;in Mississippi&nbsp;to build two data centers&nbsp;that&nbsp;are projected to create at least 1,000 jobs.</p>

<p>Advertising continues to grow, becoming an increasingly important profit driver.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Advertising revenue grew 24%&nbsp;to $11.8 billion, outpacing&nbsp;both&nbsp;retail and cloud computing&nbsp;growth, as well as StreetAccount&rsquo;s estimate of $11.7 billion.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;the first report since&nbsp;Amazon&nbsp;introduced ads&nbsp;in Prime Video,&nbsp;which analysts expect to generate&nbsp;significant revenue over time.&nbsp;Despite being new to the ad business, Amazon has emerged as one of the big players in the online advertising arena. CEO&nbsp;Andy Jassy&nbsp;has made it clear that the e-commerce and cloud titan will continue to focus on its ad efforts, as it plans&nbsp;include more of its sponsored content on its Prime Video platform.</p>

<p>First quarter results across the board show that online ads have rebounded. Last week, Alphabet also announced its ad business reaccelerated after a tough 2022 and 2023.&nbsp;Google reported total ad sales rose&nbsp;from last year&rsquo;s comparable quarter, when they amounted to&nbsp;$54.55 billion,&nbsp;to&nbsp;$61.66 billion.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Second Quarter Outlook</h3>

<p>Amazon&nbsp;expects&nbsp;profitability&nbsp;growth to continue in the current&nbsp;quarter but at a more measured pace&nbsp;as it guided for an&nbsp;operating income&nbsp;between&nbsp;$10 billion&nbsp;and&nbsp;$14 billion, on the back of revenue in the range between&nbsp;$144 billion to $149 billion, translating to revenue growth in the range between&nbsp;7%&nbsp;and&nbsp;11%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amazon&rsquo;s disciplined focus on efficiency is showing results.</p>

<p>Cost-cutting across the board, fulfillment operations tweaks and stabilization of cloud spending all partially contributed to the&nbsp;earnings growth&nbsp;as Amazon focused to&nbsp;grow&nbsp;its most&nbsp;profitable services, including&nbsp;advertising, cloud computing, Prime memberships and its third-party marketplace.</p>

<p>Amazon continues to stand out among its Big Tech peers as it is yet&nbsp;to implement a quarterly dividend. In February,&nbsp;Meta announced&nbsp;its first dividend&nbsp;at&nbsp;50 cents a share. Last week, Alphabet followed the footsteps of Meta as it announced its first ever&nbsp;dividend of 20 cents a share.</p>

Upwallstreet,"<p>Like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/META#NASDAQ"">META</a>), Snap Inc (NYSE:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/SNAP#NYSE"">SNAP</a>) and Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOG#NASDAQ"">GOOG</a>)(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ"">GOOGL</a>),&nbsp;&nbsp;Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/AMZN#NASDAQ"">AMZN</a>) reported better-than-expected quarterly results, with stronger than expected revenue being the result of the improvements on the ad business front.</p>

<h3>First Quarter Highlights</h3>

<p>In part due to its booming&nbsp;AWS division and its advertising service, Amazon reported&nbsp;revenue grew&nbsp;12.52%&nbsp;YoY to $143.3 billion,&nbsp;surpassing LSEG&rsquo;s estimate of&nbsp;$142.5 billion.&nbsp;Operating income&nbsp;far outpaced revenue growth as well as it&nbsp;soared more than 200%&nbsp;to&nbsp;$15.3 billion, which is the first&nbsp;sign that Amazon&rsquo;s cost-cutting initiatives&nbsp;and efficiency improvements are benefiting the bottom line as net income&nbsp;skyrocketed 229% YoY to&nbsp;$10.43&nbsp;billion,&nbsp;with diluted EPS amounting to&nbsp;98 cents a share, surpassing LSEG&rsquo;s estimate of&nbsp;83 cents.</p>

<p>Amazon&rsquo;s businesses are thriving, beginning with party seller services that cover commissions that Amazon collects, along with&nbsp;fulfillment, shipping fees and other charges, grew&nbsp;16%&nbsp;YoY&nbsp;to $34.5 billion.</p>

<p>AWS&nbsp;continues to grow and challenge Google and Microsoft, both the cloud and AI front.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;AWS division&nbsp;reported a&nbsp;17%&nbsp;YoY growth&nbsp;to $25 billion, surpassing StreetAccount&rsquo;s estimate of&nbsp;$24.5 billion&nbsp;and reflecting Amazon&rsquo;s strong positioning compared to its AI rivals,&nbsp;Microsoft&nbsp;Corporation (NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/MSFT#NASDAQ"">MSFT</a>), who secured a leadership position with its early entry and OpenAI acquisition,&nbsp;and Alphabet, with the latter finally catching up to its peers in their efforts&nbsp;to lead&nbsp;the way&nbsp;into the golden age of&nbsp;AI.</p>

<p>AWS&rsquo; actions could spell trouble for Alphabet and Microsoft as&nbsp;Jassy&nbsp;revealed&nbsp;significant investments over the next few years to build new infrastructure and data centers.&nbsp;Amazon will be&nbsp;investing&nbsp;$5.3 billion in Saudi Arabia and $5 billion in Mexico&nbsp;to&nbsp;build new infrastructure centers, along with&nbsp;$10 billion&nbsp;in Mississippi&nbsp;to build two data centers&nbsp;that&nbsp;are projected to create at least 1,000 jobs.</p>

<p>Advertising continues to grow, becoming an increasingly important profit driver.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Advertising revenue grew 24%&nbsp;to $11.8 billion, outpacing&nbsp;both&nbsp;retail and cloud computing&nbsp;growth, as well as StreetAccount&rsquo;s estimate of $11.7 billion.&nbsp;This is&nbsp;the first report since&nbsp;Amazon&nbsp;introduced ads&nbsp;in Prime Video,&nbsp;which analysts expect to generate&nbsp;significant revenue over time.&nbsp;Despite being new to the ad business, Amazon has emerged as one of the big players in the online advertising arena. CEO&nbsp;Andy Jassy&nbsp;has made it clear that the e-commerce and cloud titan will continue to focus on its ad efforts, as it plans&nbsp;include more of its sponsored content on its Prime Video platform.</p>

<p>First quarter results across the board show that online ads have rebounded. Last week, Alphabet also announced its ad business reaccelerated after a tough 2022 and 2023.&nbsp;Google reported total ad sales rose&nbsp;from last year&rsquo;s comparable quarter, when they amounted to&nbsp;$54.55 billion,&nbsp;to&nbsp;$61.66 billion.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Second Quarter Outlook</h3>

<p>Amazon&nbsp;expects&nbsp;profitability&nbsp;growth to continue in the current&nbsp;quarter but at a more measured pace&nbsp;as it guided for an&nbsp;operating income&nbsp;between&nbsp;$10 billion&nbsp;and&nbsp;$14 billion, on the back of revenue in the range between&nbsp;$144 billion to $149 billion, translating to revenue growth in the range between&nbsp;7%&nbsp;and&nbsp;11%.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amazon&rsquo;s disciplined focus on efficiency is showing results.</p>

<p>Cost-cutting across the board, fulfillment operations tweaks and stabilization of cloud spending all partially contributed to the&nbsp;earnings growth&nbsp;as Amazon focused to&nbsp;grow&nbsp;its most&nbsp;profitable services, including&nbsp;advertising, cloud computing, Prime memberships and its third-party marketplace.</p>

<p>Amazon continues to stand out among its Big Tech peers as it is yet&nbsp;to implement a quarterly dividend. In February,&nbsp;Meta announced&nbsp;its first dividend&nbsp;at&nbsp;50 cents a share. Last week, Alphabet followed the footsteps of Meta as it announced its first ever&nbsp;dividend of 20 cents a share.</p>

<p>&#8220;I'm super excited to welcome Jason Taylor to Microsoft, who starts today reporting to me as CVP [corporate vice president] &amp; Deputy CTO for our AI supercomputing efforts,&#8221; Scott wrote.</p>

<p>As <a href=""https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137391/microsoft-hires-meta-ai-supercomputing-jason-taylor"">reported</a> by The Verge, Taylor held various roles at Meta, including vice president of infrastructure, where he oversaw AI, data and privacy infrastructure, as well as managed server budgets.</p>



<p>He also chaired the Open Compute Project Foundation from 2015 to 2017, promoting open-source designs in data centers.</p>



<p>Microsoft and OpenAI are striving to enhance their hardware capabilities to keep pace with the rapid advancements in AI technology. </p>



<p>Recent reports suggested plans to construct a $100 billion supercomputer named &#8220;Stargate,&#8221; although Scott appears to downplay these rumors in his LinkedIn post, labeling much of the speculation as &#8220;amusingly wrong.&#8221;</p>



<p>This move follows Microsoft&#8217;s hiring of <strong>Mustafa Suleyman</strong>, co-founder of <strong>Alphabet Inc</strong>&#8216;s (NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOGL#NASDAQ"">GOOGL</a>)(NASDAQ:<a class=""ticker"" href=""https://www.benzinga.com/stock/GOOG#NASDAQ"">GOOG</a>) <strong>Google DeepMind, </strong>as the CEO of a new consumer AI division in March.
