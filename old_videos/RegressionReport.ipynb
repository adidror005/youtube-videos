    "# Regression Analysis in Finance\n",
    "## Goal: Predict \"Simple Returns\" or \"Log Returns\"\n",
    "\n",
    "In this video we will focus on Simple Returns:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simple Returns:** $$\\text{Simple Returns} = \\frac{S_{t+1} - S_t}{S_t}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Returns and Log Returns**\n",
    "- **Returns**: The percentage change in the value of a financial asset over a specified period. It is calculated as `(Current Price - Previous Price) / Previous Price`.\n",
    "- **Log Returns**: The natural logarithm of the ratio of the current price to the previous price. Calculated as `log(Current Price / Previous Price)`. Log returns are useful for mathematical simplicity and are more symmetric compared to simple returns, making them preferable in certain financial analyses.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean Squared Error (MSE)**\n",
    "* *Definition*: Measures the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value.\n",
    "* *Formula*: `MSE = 1/N * sum((y_i - y_hat_i)^2)`\n",
    "    - Where:\n",
    "        - `N` is the number of samples\n",
    "        - `y_i` is the actual value\n",
    "        - `y_hat_i` is the predicted value.\n",
    "* *Interpretation*: A lower MSE indicates a model that is closer to the true data points. The scale of MSE is dependent on the data and thus it can be hard to interpret the raw numbers without context.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**\n",
    "* *Definition*: The square root of the mean squared error.\n",
    "* *Formula*: `RMSE = sqrt(MSE)`\n",
    "    - Provides a measure of the average magnitude of the error.\n",
    "* *Interpretation*: RMSE improves interpretability of MSE by scaling it back to the original data units, making it more understandable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**\n",
    "* *Definition*: Measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction.\n",
    "* *Formula*: `MAE = 1/N * sum(|y_i - y_hat_i|)`\n",
    "* *Interpretation*: Provides an average of the absolute errors between predicted and actual values. Lower values indicate better fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**R-squared (R²)**\n",
    "* *Definition*: Represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable or variables in a regression model.\n",
    "* *Formula*: `R² = 1 - (Residual Sum of Squares / Total Sum of Squares)`\n",
    "* *Interpretation*: Values range from 0 to 1. A higher R² indicates a better fit between the model and the observed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Adjusted R-squared**\n",
    "* *Definition*: Adjusted for the number of predictors in the model, providing a more accurate measure in the context of multiple regression.\n",
    "* *Formula*: Adjusts R² to reflect the number of predictors.\n",
    "* *Interpretation*: Compensates for the addition of variables that do not improve the model, offering a more precise measure of the goodness of fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Information Coefficient (IC)**\n",
    "* *Definition*: A measure used in finance to evaluate the predictive skill of a forecast model, particularly in the context of predicting returns.\n",
    "* *Formula*: `IC = correlation(predicted returns, actual returns)`\n",
    "* *Interpretation*: Ranges from -1 to 1. A positive IC indicates that the model predictions are directionally correct with respect to actual outcomes. A higher absolute value of IC suggests a stronger predictive capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Benchmark for Random Guessing in Finance**\n",
    "* *Purpose*: Provides a reference point to evaluate the performance of financial models.\n",
    "* *Example*: A model predicting returns could be benchmarked against a baseline assumption of zero return, which might represent a naive guess or the average historical return of the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages of Using Various Metrics**\n",
    "* *Comprehensive Evaluation*: Different metrics provide insights into various aspects of the model's performance, such as accuracy, error magnitude, and directionality.\n",
    "* *Suitability for Financial Data*: Financial data often exhibits characteristics like volatility and non-normal distribution; certain metrics might be more robust or informative under these conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance in Finance**\n",
    "* *Risk and Return Analysis*: Regression metrics are critical in quantifying the accuracy and reliability of predictions related to financial returns, essential for risk management and investment strategy.\n",
    "* *Model Validation*: Rigorous evaluation using these metrics ensures the robustness and reliability of predictive models in finance, guiding investment decisions and strategy formulation.\n"
