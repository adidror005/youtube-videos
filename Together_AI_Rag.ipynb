People love that for picnics, walking, or biking. Then there's the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island. Those are must-sees for tourists, but maybe locals enjoy them too. The Metropolitan Museum of Art comes to mind. Museums are a big part of NYC. Times Square is another iconic spot, especially at night with the lights.\n",

            "\n",
            "Food is a big part of New York. Maybe suggest some famous foods like pizza, bagels, or the food markets like Chelsea Market.

Maybe the American Museum of Natural History for families.\n",

            "Wait, but I should check if I'm missing any recent additions. Like the Vessel at Hudson Yards, or the Little Island park. Also, cultural areas like Chinatown or Harlem.
