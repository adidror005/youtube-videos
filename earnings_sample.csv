0,TSLA,1,2024,2024-04-23 22:30:10,"Martin Viecha: Tesla's First Quarter 2024 Q&A Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 3.00 p.m. Central Time in the Update Deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events and results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?
Elon Musk: Thanks, Martin. So to recap in Q1 we navigated several unforeseen challenges as well as the ramp of the updated Model 3 in Fremont. There was, as we all have seen, the EV adoption rate globally is under pressure and a lot of other auto manufacturers are pulling back on EVs and pursuing plug-in hybrids instead. We believe this is not the right strategy and electric vehicles will ultimately dominate the market. Despite these challenges, the Tesla team did a great job executing in a tough environment and energy storage deployments, the Megapack in particular, reached an all time high in Q1, leading to record profitability for the energy business, and that looks likely to continue to increase in the quarters and years ahead. It will increase. We actually know that it will, so significantly faster than the car business as we expected. We also continue to expand our AI training capacity in Q1, more than doubling our training compute sequentially. In terms of the new product roadmap, there has been a lot of talk about our upcoming vehicle line in the next – in the past several weeks. We've updated our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of new models ahead, previously mentioned startup production in the second half of 2025, so we expect it to be more like the early 2025, if not late this year. These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will use aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to produce on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle lineup. So it's not contingent on any new factory or massive new production line. It'll be made on our current production lines much more efficiently. And we think this should allow us to get to over 3 million vehicles of capacity when realized to the full extent. Regarding FSD Version 12, which is the pure AI-based self-driving, if you haven't experienced this, I strongly urge you to try it out. It's profound and the rate of improvement is rapid so – and we've now turned that on for all cars with the cameras and inference computer and everything from Hardware 3 on in North America. And so it's been pushed out to, I think, around 1.8 million vehicles and we're seeing about half of people use it so far and that percentage is increasing with each passing week. So we now have over 300 billion miles that have been driven with FSD V12. Since the launch of full self-driving, supervised full self-driving, it's become very clear that the vision-based approach with end to end neural networks is the right solution for scalable autonomy. It's really how humans drive. Our entire road network is designed for biological neural nets and eyes. So naturally cameras and digital neural nets are the solution to our current road system. To make it more accessible, we've reduced the subscription price to $99 a month, so it's easy to try out. And as we've announced, we'll be showcasing our purpose-built robotaxi, or Cybercab, in August. Yes. Regarding AI compute, over the past few months, we've been actively working on expanding Tesla's core AI infrastructure. For a while there, we were training constrained in our progress. We are, at this point, no longer training constrained and so we're making rapid progress. We've installed and commissioned, meaning they're actually working 35,000 H100 computers or GPUs, GPU is wrong word, they need a new word. I always feel like a wince when I say GPU because it's not – GPU stands – G stands for graphics, and it doesn't do graphics. But anyway roughly 35,000 H100s are active, and we expect that to be probably 85,000 or thereabouts by the end of this year and training, just for training. We are making sure that we're being as efficient as possible in our training. It's not just about the number of H100s, but how efficiently they're used. So in conclusion, we're super excited about our autonomy road map. I think it should be obvious to anyone who's driving Version 12 and it tells that that it is only a matter of time before we exceed the reliability of humans and not much time with that. And we're really headed for an electric vehicle, an autonomous future. And I'll go back to something I said several years ago that in the future, gasoline cars that are not autonomous will be like riding a horse and using a flip phone. And that will become very obvious in hindsight. We continue to make the necessary investments that will drive growth and profits for Tesla in the future, and I wanted to thank the Tesla team for incredible execution during this period and look forward to everything that we have planned ahead. Thanks.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much, and Vaibhav has some comments as well.
Vaibhav Taneja: Thanks. It's important to acknowledge what Elon said, from our auto business perspective. We did see a seasonal decline in revenues quarter-over-quarter and those were primarily because of seasonality, uncertain macroeconomic environment and the other reasons, which Elon had mentioned earlier. Auto margins declined from 18.9% to 18.5%. Excluding the impact of Cybertruck, the impact of pricing actions was largely offset by reductions in per unit costs and the recognition of revenue from Autopark feature for certain vehicles in the U.S. that previously did not have that functionality. Additionally, while we did experience higher cost due to the ramp of Model 3 in Fremont and disruptions in Berlin, these costs were largely offset by cost reduction initiatives. In fact, if we exclude Cybertruck and Fremont Model 3 ramp costs, the revenue from Autopark, auto margins improved slightly. Currently normalized Model Y cost per vehicle in Austin and Berlin are already very close to that of Fremont. Our ability to reduce costs without sacrificing on quality was due to the amazing efforts of the team, in executing Tesla's relentless pursuit of efficiency across the business. We've also witnessed that as other OEMs are pulling back on their investments in EV, there is increasing appetite for credits, and that means a steady stream of revenue for us. Obviously, seeing others pull back from EV is not the future we want. We would prefer it the whole industry went all in. On the demand front, we've undertaken a variety of initiatives, including lowering the price of both the purchase and subscription options for FSD launching extremely attractive leasing specials for the Model 3 in the U.S. for $299 a month and offering attractive financing options in certain markets. We believe that our awareness activities, paired with attractive financing, will go a long way in expanding our reach and driving demand for our products. Our Energy business continues to make meaningful progress with margins reaching a record of 24.6%. We expect the energy storage deployments for 2024 to grow at least 75% higher from 2023. And accordingly, this business will begin contributing significantly to our overall profitability. Note that there is a bit of lumpiness in our storage deployments due to a variety of factors that are outside of our control, so deployments may fluctuate quarter-over-quarter. On the operating expense front, we saw a sequential increase from our AI initiatives, continued investment in future projects, marketing and other activities. We had negative free cash flow of $2.5 billion in the first quarter. The primary driver of this was an increase in inventory from a mismatch between builds and deliveries as discussed before, and our elevated spend on CapEx across various initiatives, including AI compute. We expect the inventory build to reverse in the second quarter and free cash flow to return to positive again. As we prepare the company for the next phase of growth, we had to make the hard but necessary decision to reduce our head count by over 10%. The savings generated are expected to be well in excess of $1 billion on an annual run rate basis. We are also getting hyper focused on CapEx efficiency and utilizing our installed capacity in a more efficient manner. The savings from these initiatives, including our cost reductions will help improve our overall profitability and ultimately enable us to increase the scale of our investments in AI. In conclusion, the future is extremely bright and the journey to get there while challenging will be extremely rewarding. Once again, I would like to thank the whole Tesla team for delivering great results. And we can open it up to Q&A.
A - Martin Viecha: Okay. Let's start with investor Q&A. The first question is, what is the status of 4680. What is the current output? Lars?
Lars Moravy : Sure. 4680 production increased about 18% to 20% from Q4 reaching greater than 1K a week for Cybertruck, which is about 7 gigawatt hours per year as we posted on X. We expect to stay ahead of the Cybertruck ramp with the cell production throughout Q2 as we ramp the third of four lines in Phase 1, while maintaining multiple weeks of cell inventory to make sure we're ahead of the ramp. Because we're ramping, COGS continues to drop rapidly week-over-week driven by yield improvements throughout the lines and production volume increases. So our goal, and we expect to do this is to beat supplier cost of nickel-based cells by the end of the year.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The second question is on Optimus. So what is the current status of Optimus? Are they currently performing any factory tasks? When do you expect to start mass production?
Elon Musk: We are able to do simple factory tasks or at least, I should say, factory tasks in the lab. In terms of – we do think we will have Optimus in limited production in the natural factory itself, doing useful tasks before the end of this year. And then I think we may be able to sell it externally by the end of next year. These are just guesses. As I've said before, I think Optimus will be more valuable than everything else combined. Because if you've got a sentient humanoid robots that is able to navigate reality and do tasks at request, there is no meaningful limit to the size of the economy. So that's what is going to happen. And I think Tesla is best positioned of any humanoid robot maker to be able to reach volume production with efficient inference on the robot itself. I mean this perhaps is a point that is worth emphasizing Tesla's AI inference efficiency is vastly better than any other company. There is no company even close to the inference efficiency of Tesla. We've had to do that because we were constrained by the inference hardware in the car, we didn't have a choice. But that will pay dividends in many ways.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The third question is, what is the current assessment of the pathway towards regulatory approval for unsupervised FSD in the U.S. And how should we think about the appropriate safety threshold compared to human drivers?
Elon Musk: Sure.
Lars Moravy: I can start. There are a handful of states that already have adopted autonomous vehicle laws. These states are paving the way for operations, while the data for such operations guides a broader adoption of driver-less vehicles. I think Ashok can talk a little bit about our safety methodology, but we expect that these states and the work ongoing as well as the data that we're providing will pave a way for a broad-based regulatory approval in the U.S. at least and then in other countries as well?
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes. It's actually been pretty helpful that other autonomous car companies have been cutting a path through the regulatory jungle, which is absurd. That's actually quite helpful. And they have obviously been operating in San Francisco for a while. I think they got approval for City of LA. So these approvals are happening rapidly. I think if you've got at scale, a statistically significant amount of data that shows conclusively that the autonomous car has, let's say, half the accident rate of a human-driven car, I think, that's difficult to ignore because at that point, stopping autonomy means killing people. So I actually do not think that there will be significant regulatory barriers provided there was conclusive data that the autonomous car is safer than a human-driven car. And in my view, this will be much like elevators. Elevators used to be operated by a guy with relay switch. But sometimes that guy would get tired or drunk or just make a mistake, and shatter somebody in half between floors. So we just get an elevator and press button, we don't think about it. In fact, it's kind of weird if somebody is standing there with a relay switch. And that will be how cars work. You just summon the car using your phone, you get in, it takes you to a destination, you get out.
Vaibhav Taneja: You don't even think about it?
Elon Musk: You don't even think about it. Just like an elevator, it takes you to your floor. That's it. Don't think about how the elevator is working or anything like that. And something I should clarify is that Tesla will be operating the fleet. So you can think of like how Tesla, think of it’s like some combination of Airbnb and Uber, meaning that there will be some number of cars that Tesla owns itself and operates in the fleet. There will be some number of cars and then there'll be a bunch of cars where they're owned by the end user. That end user can add or subtract their car to the fleet whenever they want, and they can decide if they want to only let the car be used by friends and family or only by 5-star users or by anyone at any time they could have the car come back to them and be exclusively theirs, like an Airbnb. You could rent out your guest room or not, any time you want. So as our fleet grows, we have 7 million cars going to – 9 million cars going to, eventually tens of millions of cars worldwide. With a constant feedback loop, every time something goes wrong, that gets added to the training data and you get this training flywheel happening in the same way that Google Search has the sort of flywheel, it's very difficult to compete with Google because people are constantly doing searches and clicking and Google is getting that feedback loop. It’s the same with Tesla. But at a scale that is maybe difficult to comprehend, but ultimately, it will be tens of millions. I think there's also some potential here for an AWS element down the road where if we've got very powerful inference because we've got a Hardware 3 in the cars, but now all cars are being made with Hardware 4. Hardware 5 is pretty much designed and should be in cars, hopefully towards the end of next year. And there's a potential to run – when the car is not moving to actually run distributed inference. So kind of like AWS, but distributed inference. Like it takes a lot of computers to train an AI model, but many orders of magnitude less compute to run it. So if you can imagine future, perhaps where there's a fleet of 100 million Teslas, and on average, they've got like maybe a kilowatt of inference compute. That's 100 gigawatts of inference compute distributed all around the world. It's pretty hard to put together 100 gigawatts of AI compute. And even in an autonomous future where the car is, perhaps, used instead of being used 10 hours a week, it is used 50 hours a week. That still leaves over 100 hours a week where the car inference computer could be doing something else. And it seems like it will be a waste not to use it.
Martin Viecha: Ashok, do you want to chime in on the air process and safety?
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes, we have multiple tiers of validating the safety in any given week, we train hundreds of neural networks that can produce different trajectories for how to drive the car, we replay them through the millions of clips that we have already collected from our users and our own QA. Those are like critical events, like someone jumping out in front or like other critical events that we have gathered database over many, many years, and we replay through all of them to make sure that we are net improving safety. And on top of it, we have simulation systems that also try to recreate this and test this in closed loop fashion. And some of this is validated, we give it to our own QA drivers. We have hundreds of them in different cities, in San Francisco, Los Angeles, Austin, New York, a lot of different locations. They are also driving this and collecting real-world miles, and we have an estimate of what are the critical events, are they a net improvement compared to the previous week’s builds. And once we have confidence that the build is a net improvement, then we start shipping to early users, like 2,000 employees initially that they would like it to build, they will give feedback on like if it's an improvement there or they're noting some new issues that we did not capture in our own QA process. And only after all of this is validated, then we go to external customers. And even when we go external, we have like live dashboards of monitoring every critical event that's happening in the fleet sorted by the criticality of it. So we are having a constant pulse on the build quality and the safety improvement along the way. And then any failures like Elon alluded to, we get the data back, add it to the training and that improves the model in the next cycle. So we have this like constant feedback loop of issues, fixes, evaluations and then rinse and repeat. And especially with the new V12 architecture, all of this is automatically improving without requiring much engineering interventions in the sense that engineers don't have to be creative in like how they code the algorithms. It's mostly learning on its own based on data. So you see that, okay, every failure or like this is how a person shows, this is how you drive this intersection or something like that, they get the data back. We add it to the neural network, and it learns from that trained data automatically instead of some engineers saying that, oh, here, you must rotate the steering wheel by this much or something like that. There's no hard inference conditions, it's everything is neural network, it's very soft, it's probabilistic. So it will adapt its probability distribution based on the new data that it's getting.
Elon Musk: Yes. We do have some insight into how good the things will be in like, let's say, three or four months because we have advanced models that are far more capable than what is in the car, but have some issues with them that we need to fix. So they are like there'll be a step change improvement in the capabilities of the car, but it will have some quirks that are – that need to be addressed in order to release it. As Ashok was saying, we have to be very careful in what we release the fleet or to customers in general. So like – if we look at say 12.4 and 12.5, which are really could arguably even be Version 13, Version 14 because it's pretty close to a total retrain of the neural nets in each case are substantially different. So we have good insight into where the model is, how well the car will perform, in, say, three or four months.
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes. In terms of scaling laws, people in the AI community generally talk about model scaling laws where they increase the model size a lot and then their corresponding gains in performance, but we have also figured out scaling laws and other access in addition to the model side scaling, making also data scaling. You can increase the amount of data you use to train the neural network and that also gives similar gains and you can also scale up by training compute, you can train it for much longer or make more GPUs or more Dojo nodes and that also gives better performance, and you can also have architecture scaling where you count with better architectures that for the same amount of compute for produce better results. So a combination of model size scaling, data scaling, training compute scaling and the architecture scaling, we can basically extract like, okay, with the continue scaling based on this – at this ratio, we can sort of predict future performance. Obviously, it takes time to do the experiments because it takes a few weeks to train, it takes a few weeks to collect tens of millions of video clips and process all of them, but you can estimate what’s going to be the future progress based on the trends that we have seen in the past, and they’re generally held true based on past data.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you very much. I’ll go to the next question, which is, can we get an official announcement of the time line for the $25,000 vehicle?
Lars Moravy: I think we – Elon mentioned it in the opening remarks. But as you mentioned, we’re updating our future vehicle lineup to accelerate the launch of our low-cost vehicles in a more CapEx efficient way. That’s our mission to get the most affordable cars to customers as fast as possible. These new vehicles we built on our existing lines and open capacity, and that’s a major shift to utilize all our capacity with marginal CapEx before we go spend high CapEx to do anything.
Elon Musk: Yes. We’ll talk about this more on August 8. But really, the way to think of Tesla is almost entirely in terms of solving autonomy and being able to turn on that autonomy for a gigantic fleet. And I think it might be the biggest asset value appreciation history when that day happens when you can do unsupervised full self-driving.
Lars Moravy: 5 million cars?
Elon Musk: Yes.
Lars Moravy: A little less?
Elon Musk: Yes. It will be 7 million cars in a year or so and then 10 million and then eventually, we’re talking about tens of millions of cars. Not eventually, it’s like, yes, for the end of the decade, its several tens of millions of cars I think.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, what is the progress of Cybertruck ramp?
Lars Moravy: I can take that one too. Cybertruck had 1K a week just a couple of weeks ago. This happened in the first four to five months since we SOP [ph] late last year. Of course, volume production is what matters. That’s what drives costs and so our costs are dropping, but the ramp still faces like a lot of challenges with so many new technologies, some supplier limitations, et cetera, and continue to ramp this year, just focusing on cost efficiency and quality.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you. The next question, have any of the legacy automakers contacted Tesla about possibly licensing FSD in the future?
Elon Musk: We’re in conversations with one major automaker regarding licensing FSD.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is about the robotaxi unveil. Elon already talked about that. So we’ll have to wait till August. The following question is about the next-generation vehicle. We already talked about that. So let’s go to the semi. What is the time line for scaling semi?
Elon Musk: I think…
Lars Moravy: So we’re finalizing the engineering of the semi to enable like a super cost-effective high-volume production with our learnings from our fleet and our pilot fleet and Pepsi’s fleet, which we are expanding this year marginally. In parallel, as we showed in the shareholders’ deck, we have started construction on the factory in Reno. Our first vehicles are planned for late 2025 with external customers starting in 2026.
Martin Viecha: Okay. A couple more questions. So our favorite, can we make FSD transfer permanent until FSD is fully delivered with Level 5 autonomy?
Lars Moravy: Yes.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Next question, what is the getting the production ramp at Lathrop, where do you see the Megapack run rate at the end of the year. Mike?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes. Yes, Lathrop is ramping as planned. We have our second GA line allowing us to increase our exit rate from 20 gigawatt hours per year to – at the start of this year to 40 gigawatt hours per year by the end of the year, that lines commissioned. There’s really nothing limiting the ramp. Its given the longer sales cycles for these large projects, we typically have order visibility 12 months to 24 months prior to ship dates. So we’re able to plan – the build plan several quarters in advance. So this allows us to ramp the factory to align with the business and order growth. Lastly, we’d like to thank our customers globally for their trust in Tesla as a partner for these incredible projects.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you very much. Let’s go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Tony Sacconaghi from Bernstein. Tony, please go ahead and unmute.
Tony Sacconaghi: Thank you for taking the question. I was just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on kind of the new vehicles that you talked about today. Are these like tweaks on existing models, given that they’re going to be running on the same lines? Are these like new models? And how should we think about them in the context of like the Model 3 Highland update, what will these models be like relative to that? And given the quick time frame, Model 3 Highland has required a lot of work and a lot of retooling. Maybe you can help put that all in context. Thank you, and I have a follow-up, please.
Elon Musk: I think we've said, we were on that front. So what’s your follow-up?
Tony Sacconaghi: It’s a more personal one for you, Elon, which is that you’re leading many important companies right now. Maybe you can just talk about where your heart is at in terms of your interests and do you expect to lessen your involvement with Tesla at any point over the next three years?
Elon Musk: Tesla constitutes a majority of my work time and I work pretty much every day of the week. It’s rare for me to take a Sunday afternoon. So I’m going to make sure Tesla is quite prosperous. And it is – like it is prosperous and it will be very much so in the future.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you. Let’s go to Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Adam, please go ahead and unmute.
Adam Jonas: Okay. Great. Hey, Elon. So you and your team on volume expect a 2024 growth rate, notably lower than that achieved in 2023. But what's your team's degree of confidence on growth above 0%? Or in other words, does that statement leave room for potentially lower sales year-on-year?
Elon Musk: No, I think we'll have higher sales this year than last year.
Adam Jonas: Okay. My follow-up, Elon, on future product. If you had nailed execution, assuming that you nail execution on your next-gen cheaper vehicles, more aggressive giga castings, I don't want to say one piece, but getting closer to one piece, structural pack, unboxed, 300-mile range, $25,000 price point, putting aside robotaxi, those features unique to you. How long would it take your best Chinese competitors to copy a cheaper and better vehicle that you could offer a couple of years from now? How long would it take your best Chinese competitors to copy that? Thanks.
Elon Musk: I mean, I don't know what our competitors could do, except we've done relatively better than they have. If you look at the drop in our competitors in China sales versus our drop in sales, our drop was less than theirs. So we're doing well. But I think Cathy Wood said it best, like really, we should be thought of as an AI or robotics company. If you value Tesla as just like an auto company, you just have to – fundamentally, it's just the wrong framework and it will come to be. If you ask the wrong question, then the right answer is impossible. So I mean, if somebody doesn't believe Tesla is going to solve autonomy, I think they should not be an investor in the company. Like, that is – but we will and we are. And then you have a car that goes from 10 hours of use a week, like 1.5 hours a day to probably 50%, but it costs the same.
Vaibhav Taneja: I think that's the key thing to remember, right, especially if you look at FSD Supervised, if you didn't believe in autonomy, this should give you a review that this is coming. It's actually getting better day by day.
Elon Musk: Yes. If you've not tried the FSD 12.3, and like I said, 12.4 is going to be significantly better and 12.5 even better than that. And we have visibility into those things. Then you really don't understand what's going on. It's not possible.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes. And that's why we can't just look at just as a car company because a car company would just have a car. But here, we have more than a car company because the cars can be autonomous. And like I said, it's happening.
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes. This is all in addition to Tesla – the overall AI community is just like increasing – like, improving rapidly.
Elon Musk: Yes. I mean we're putting the actual auto in automobile. So sort of – we go like, well, sort of like tell us about future horse carriages you're making. I'm like, well, actually, it doesn't need a horse that's the whole point. That's really the whole point.
Martin Viecha: Okay, thank you. The next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper Sandler. Alex, please go ahead and unmute.
Alex Potter: Great, thanks. Yes, so I couldn't agree more. The thesis hinges completely on AI, the future of AI, full self-driving neural net training, all of these things. In that context, Elon, you've spoken about your desire to obtain 25% voting control of the company. And I understand completely why that would be. So I'm not necessarily asking about that. I'm asking if you've come up with any mechanism by which you can ensure that you'll obtain that level of voting control. Because if not, then the core part of the thesis could potentially be at risk. So any additional commentary you might have on that topic.
Elon Musk: Well, I think no matter what Tesla, even if I got kidnapped by aliens tomorrow, Tesla will solve autonomy, maybe a little slower, but it would solve autonomy for vehicles at least. I don't know if it would winon with respect to Optimus or with respect to future products, but it would that there's enough momentum for Tesla to solve autonomy even if I disappeared for vehicles. Yes, there's a whole range of things we can do in the future beyond that. I'll be more reticent with respect to Optimus, if we have a super-sentient humanoid robot that can follow you indoors and that you can escape, we're talking terminator-level risk. And yes, I'd be uncomfortable with. If there's not some meaningful level of influence over how that is deployed. And if there's shareholders have an opportunity to ratify or reratify the sort of competition because I can't say that. That is a fact. They have an opportunity. And yes, we'll see. If the company generates a lot of positive cash flow, we could obviously buy back shares.
Alex Potter: All right. That's actually all very helpful context. Thank you. Maybe one final question and I'll pass it on. OpEx reductions, thank you for quantifying the impact there. I'd be interested also in potentially more qualitative discussion of what the implications are for these headcount reductions. What are the types of activities that you're presumably sacrificing as a result of parting ways with these folks? Thanks very much.
Vaibhav Taneja: So like we said, we've done these headcount reductions across the board. And as companies grow over time, there are certain redundancies. There's some duplication of efforts, which happens in certain areas. So you need to go back and look at where all these pockets are, get rid of it. So we're basically going through that exercise wherein we're like, hey, how do we set this company right for the next phase of growth. And the way to think about it is any tree which grows, it needs pruning. This is the pruning exercise which we went through. And at the end of it, we'll be much stronger and much more resilient to deal with the future because the future is really bright. Like I said in my opening remarks, we just have to get through this period and get there.
Elon Musk: Yes, we're not giving up anything that is significant that I'm aware of. So we've had a long period of prosperity from 2019 to now. And so if a company sort of organizationally is 5% wrong per year, that accumulates to 25%, 30% of inefficiency. We've made some corrections along the way. But it is time to reorganize the company for the next phase of growth and you really need to reorganize it, just like a human when we start off with one cell and kind of zygote, blastocyst and you start growing arms and legs and briefly, you have a tail. And so…
Alex Potter: But you shed the tail.
Elon Musk: You shed the tail, hopefully. And then you're baby, you basically, you have to be the organism – a company is kind of like creature growing. And if you don't reorganize it for different phases of growth, it will fail. You can't have the same organizational structure if you're 10 cells versus 100 cells versus 1 million cells versus 1 billion cells versus 1 trillion cells. Humans are around 35 trillion cells, doesn't feel like it feels like, like one person. But you're basically a walking cell colony of roughly 35 trillion depending on your body mass and about three times that number in bacteria. So anyway, you've got to reorganize the company for a new phase of growth or will fail to achieve that growth.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs. Mark please go ahead and unmute.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks very much for taking the question. The company previously characterized potential FSD licensing discussions in the early phase and some OEMs had not really been believing in it. Can you elaborate on how much the licensing business opportunity you mentioned today has progressed? And is there anything Tesla needs to achieve with the technology in terms of product milestones in order to be successful at reaching a licensing agreement in your view?
Elon Musk: Well, I think we just need to – it just needs to be obvious that our approach is the right approach. And I think it is. I think we've now with 12.3, if you just have the car drive you around; it is obvious that our solution with a relatively low-cost inference computer and standard cameras can achieve self-driving. No LiDARs, no radars, no ultrasonic nothing.
Vaibhav Taneja: No heavy integration work for vehicle manufacturers.
Elon Musk: Yes. So it really just be a case of having them use the same cameras and inference computer and licensing our software. But once it becomes obvious that if you don't have this in a car, nobody wants your car. It's a smart car. I still remember in, back when Nokia was king of the hill, Yes, crushing. And they certainly come out with a smartphone that was basically a break with limited functionality. And then the iPhone and Android, people still do not understand that all the phones are going to be that way. There's not going to be any flip [ph] phones. If there will be a niche product.
Lars Moravy: Or home phones.
Elon Musk: Yes, no even exactly. When is the last time you saw a home phone.
Lars Moravy: No idea in a hotel, sometimes in hotels.
Elon Musk: Yes, the hotels have them. Yes. So the people don't understand all cars will need to be smart cars, or you will not sell or the car will not – nobody would buy it. Once that becomes obvious, I think licensing becomes not optional.
Mark Delaney: It becomes a method of survival?
Elon Musk: Yes, absolutely, it is. License it or nobody will buy your car.
Vaibhav Taneja: I mean one other thing which I'll add is in the conversations, which we've had with some of these OEMs, I just want to also point out that they take a lot of time in their product life cycle.
Elon Musk: Yes.
Vaibhav Taneja: They're talking about years before they will put it in their product. We might have a licensing deal earlier than that, but it takes a while. So this is where the big difference between us and them is, right?
Elon Musk: Yes, I mean, really a deal signed now would result in it being in a car probably three years.
Vaibhav Taneja: That would be early.
Elon Musk: Yes. That's like lightening basically.
Lars Moravy: That's in eager [ph] OEM.
Elon Musk: Yes. So I wouldn't be surprise if we do sign a deal. I think we have a good chance we do sign a deal this year, maybe more than one. But yes, it would be probably three years before it's integrated with a car. Even though all you need is cameras and our inference computer. So just talking about a massive design change.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes. And again, just to clarify, it's not the work which we have to do. It's the work which they have to do, which will take the time.
Elon Musk: Yes.
Vaibhav Taneja: Mark, is it helpful?
Mark Delaney: Yes, very helpful. Thank you. My follow-up was to better understand Tesla's approach to pricing going forward. Previously, the company had said that the price reductions were driving incremental demand with how affordable the cars have become, especially for vehicles that have access to IRA credits and some of the leasing offers that Tesla has in place. Do you still see meaningful incremental price reductions as making sense from here for the existing products? And can the company meaningfully lower prices from here and also stay free cash flow positive on an annual basis with the current product set? Thanks.
Elon Musk: Yes. I think we can be free cash flow positive meaningfully.
Lars Moravy: I think Vaibhav said it in his opening remarks, like our cost down efforts, we basically were offsetting the price cut like we’re trying to give it back to the customers.
Elon Musk: Yes. I mean the end of the day, like for any given company, if you sell a great product at a great price – if you have a great product at a great price, the sales will be excellent. That’s true of any area. So over time, we do need to keep making sure that we’re – that it’s a great product at a great price. And moreover, that price is accessible to people. So it’s not – you have to solve both the value for money and the fundamental affordability question. The fundamental affordability question is sometimes overlooked. If somebody is earning several hundred thousand dollars a year, they don’t think of a car from a fundamental affordability standpoint. But from vast majority of people are living paycheck to paycheck. So it actually makes a difference if the cost per month for lease refinancing is $10 one way or the other. So it is important to keep improving the affordability and to keep making the price.
Lars Moravy: More accessible.
Elon Musk: Yes, exactly. Make the price more accessible, the value for money better, and to keep improving that over time.
Lars Moravy: But also make kick as cost that people want to buy.
Elon Musk: Yes, it’s going to be a great product and at a great price. And the standards for what constitutes great product at a great price keep increasing. So there’s like – you can’t just be static. You have to keep making the car better, improving the price, but improving the cost of production, and that’s what we’re doing.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes. And in fact, like I said in my opening remarks also, like the revised – the updated Model 3 is a fantastic car. I don’t think people fully even understand that lot of engineering effort which has gone and Lars and team have actually put out videos explaining how much the car is different. I mean it looks and feels different. Not only it looks and feels different. We’ve added so much value to it, but you can lease it for like as low as $299 a month.
Lars Moravy: Without gas.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes.
Martin Viecha: All right. The next question comes from George from Canaccord. George, please go ahead and unmute.
Unidentified Analyst: Hi, thank you for taking my question. First, could you please help us understand some of the timing of launching FSD in additional geographies, including maybe clarifying your recent comment about China? Thank you.
Elon Musk: I mean like new markets, yes, we are – there are a bunch of markets where we don’t currently sell cars that we should be selling cars in. We’ll see some acceleration of that.
Unidentified Analyst: And FSD new markets?
Elon Musk: Yes. So think about the end-to-end neural net-based autonomy is that just like a human, it actually works pretty well without modification in almost any market. So we plan on – with the approval of the regulators, releasing it as a supervised autonomy system in any market that – where we can get regulatory approval for that, which we think includes China. So yes, it’s – just like a human, you can go rent a car in a foreign country and you can drive pretty well. Obviously, if you live in that country, you’ll drive better. And so we’ll make the car drive better in these other countries with country-specific training. But it can drive quite well almost everywhere.
Vaibhav Taneja: The basics of driving are basically same everywhere like car is a car, the traffic lights, road is the road. Yes.
Elon Musk: It understands that it shouldn’t hit things, no matter what the road rules are.
Vaibhav Taneja: Exactly. There are some road rules that you need to follow. And in China, you shouldn’t cross over a solid line to do a lane change. In U.S. it’s a recommendation I think. In China, you get fined heavily if you do that. We have to do some more actions, but it’s mostly smaller reduction. It’s not like the entire change or type or something.
Elon Musk: Yes.
Martin Viecha: Hey, George, do you have a follow-up?
Unidentified Analyst: Yes. So my follow-up has to do with the first quarter deliveries and I’m curious as to whether or not you feel that supply constraints that you mentioned throughout the release impacted the results and maybe can you help us quantify that? And is that why you have some confidence in unit growth in 2024?
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes. I think we did cover this a little bit in the opening remarks to you. Q1 had a lot of different things which are happening. Seasonality was a big one, continued pressure from the macroeconomic environment. We had attacks at our factory. We had Red Sea attacks, we are ramping Model 3, we’re ramping Cybertruck. All these things are happening. I mean, it almost feels like a culmination of all those activities in a constrained period. And that gives us that confidence that, hey, we don’t expect these things to recur.
Elon Musk: Yes. We think Q2 will be a lot better.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes.
Lars Moravy: It’s just one thing after another. Our Cybertrucks are crazy. Thank you.
Elon Musk: Yes, exactly. It’s just – if you’ve got cars that are sitting on ships, they obviously cannot delivered to people. And if you’ve got the excess demand for Model 3 and Model Y in one market, but you don’t have it there. It’s quite a – it’s extremely complex logistics situation. So I’d say also the – we did overcomplicate the sales process, which we’ve just in the past week or so have greatly simplified. So it became far too complex to buy a Tesla, whereas it should just be you can buy the car in under a minute. So we’re getting back to that you can buy a Tesla in under an minute interface from what was quite complex.
Martin Viecha: Okay, thank you. Let’s go to Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Colin, go ahead and unmute, please.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Given the pursuit of Tesla really as a leader in AI for the physical world, in your comments around distributed inference, can you talk about what that approach is unlocking beyond what’s happening in the vehicle right now?
Elon Musk: Do you want to say something?
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes. Like Elon mentioned like the car even when it's a full robotaxi it's probably going to be used 150 hours a week.
Elon Musk: That's my guess like a third of the hours of the week.
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes. It could be more or less, but then there's certainly going to be some hours left for charging and cleaning and maintenance in that world, you can do a lot of other workloads, even right now we are seeing, for example, these LLM companies have these like batch workloads where they send a bunch of documents and those run through pretty large neural networks and take a lot of compute to chunk through those workloads. And now that we have already paid for this compute in these cars, it might be wise to use them and not let them be idle, be like buying a lot of expensive machinery and leaving to them idle. Like we don't want that, we want to use the computer as much as possible and close to like basically 100% of the time to make it a use of it.
Elon Musk: That’s right. I think it's analogous to Amazon Web Services, where people didn't expect that AWS would be the most valuable part of Amazon when it started out as a bookstore. So that was on nobody's radar. But they found that they had excess compute because the compute needs would spike to extreme levels for brief periods of the year and then they had idle compute for the rest of the year. So then what should they do to pull that excess compute for the rest of the year? That's kind of...
Ashok Elluswamy: Monetize it
Elon Musk: Yes, monetize it. So, it seems like kind of a no-brainer to say, okay, if we've got millions and then tens of millions of vehicles out there where the computers are idle most of the time that we might well have them do something useful.
Ashok Elluswamy: Exactly.
Elon Musk: And then, I mean, if you get like to the 100 million vehicle level, which I think we will, at some point, get to, then – and you've got a kilowatt of useable compute and maybe your own hardware 6 or 7 by that time. Then you really – I think you could have on the order of 100 gigawatts of useful compute, which might be more than anyone more than any company, probably more than a company.
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes, probably because it takes a lot of intelligence to drive the car anyway. And when it's not driving the car, you just put this intelligence to other uses, solving scientific problems or answer in terms of someone else.
Elon Musk: It's like a human, ideally. We've already learned about deploying workloads to these nodes
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes. And unlike laptops and our cell phones, it is totally under Tesla's control. So it's easier to distribute the workload across different nodes as opposed to asking users for permission on their own cell phones to be very tedious.
Elon Musk: Well, you're just draining the battery on the phone.
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes, exactly. The battery is also...
Elon Musk: So like technically, I suppose like Apple would have the most amount of distributed compute, but you can't use it because you can't get the – you can't just run the phone at full power and drain the battery.
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes.
Elon Musk: So, whereas for the car, even if you're a kilowatt level inference computer, which is crazy power compared to a phone. If you've got 50 or 60 kilowatt hour pack, it's still not a big deal to run if you are plugged it – whether you plugged it or not – you could be plugged in or not like you could run for 10 hours and use 10-kilowatt hours of your kilowatt of compute power.
Lars Moravy: Yes. We got built in like liquid cold thermal management.
Elon Musk: Yes, exactly.
Lars Moravy: Exactly for data centers, it's already there in the car.
Elon Musk: Exactly. Yes. Its distributed power generation – distributed access to power and distributed cooling, that was already paid for.
Ashok Elluswamy: Yes. I mean that distributed power and cooling, people underestimate that costs a lot of money.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes. And the CapEx is shared by the entire world sort of everyone wants a small chunk, and they get a small profit out of it, maybe.
Elon Musk: Yes.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much guys. And just my follow-up is a little bit more mundane. Looking at the 4680 ramp, can you talk about how close you were to target yields and when you might start to accelerate incremental capacity expansions on that technology?
Elon Musk: We're making good progress on that. But I don't think it's super important for at least in the near term. As Lars said, we think it will be exceed the competitiveness of suppliers by the end of this year and then we'll continue to improve.
Lars Moravy: Yes. I mean, I think it's important to note also that like the ramp right now is relevant to the Cybertruck ramp.
Elon Musk: Yes.
Lars Moravy: And so like we're not going to just randomly build 4680s unless we have a place to put them and so we're going to make sure we're prudent about that. But we also have a lot of investments with all our cell suppliers and vendors. They're great partners, and they've done great development work with us and a lot of the advancements in technologies and chemistry we found 4680, they're also putting into their cells.
Elon Musk: Yes. I mean a big part of the 4680, Tesla doing internal cells was a hedge against what would happen with our suppliers because for a while they are it was very difficult because every big carmaker put in massive battery orders, and so the price per kilowatt hour of lithium-ion batteries went to crazy numbers, crazy levels.
Vaibhav Taneja: Bonkers.
Elon Musk: Yes, just bonkers. So like, okay, we've got to have some hedge here to deal with cost per kilowatt hours of numbers that were double what we anticipated. If we have an internal cell production, then we have that hedge against demand shocks, we have too much demand. That's really the way to think about it. It's not like we want to take on a whole bunch of problems just for the hell of it. We did the cell program in order to address the crazy increase in cost per kilowatt hour from our suppliers due to gigantic orders placed by every carmaker on earth.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you. And the last question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird. Ben, go ahead and unmute. Ben, you're still muted.
Elon Musk: Well, I want to say again, we'd just like to strongly recommend that anyone who is, I guess, thinking about the Tesla stock should really drive FSD 12.3. It really – you can't – it's impossible to understand the company if you do not do this.
Martin Viecha: All right. So since Ben is not unmuting. Let's try Shreyas Patil from Wolfe Research. Final question.
Shreyas Patil: Thanks so much. Just Elon, during the Investor Day last year, you mentioned that auto COGS per unit for the next-gen vehicle would decline by 50% versus the current three and Y. I think that was implying something around $20,000 of COGS. About one-third of that was coming from the on-box manufacturing process. But I'm curious if you see an opportunity that the – some of the other drivers around powertrain cost reduction or material cost savings, would those be largely transferable to some of the new products that you're now talking about introducing?
Lars Moravy: Yes, sure. I mean, in short, yes, I mean, like the on-box manufacturing method is certainly great and revolutionary, but with it comes some risks because new production lines and not, but all the subsystems we developed, whether it was powertrains, drive units, battery improvements in manufacturing and automation, thermal systems, seating, integration of interior components and reduction of LV controllers, all that's transferable, and that's what we're doing, trying to get it in their products as fast as possible. And so yes, that engineering work, we're not trying to just throw it away and put a cars and we're going to take it and utilize it and utilize it to the best advantage of the cars we make and the future cars make.
Shreyas Patil: Okay. Great. And then just on that topic of 4680 cells, I know you mentioned it, you really thought of it more as like a hedge against rising battery costs from other OEMs. But it seems even today, it seems like you would have a cost advantage against some of those other automakers. And I'm wondering, given the rationalizing of your vehicle manufacturing plans that you're talking about now, if there's an opportunity to maybe convert the 4680 cells and maybe sell those to other automakers and really generate an additional revenue stream. I'm just curious if you have any thoughts about that.
Elon Musk: Great. What seems to be happening is that the I'm missing something, the orders for batteries from other automakers have declined dramatically. So we're seeing much more competitive prices for sales from our suppliers, dramatically more competitive than in the past. It is clear that a lot of our suppliers have excess capacity.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes. In addition to what Elon, this is kind of in addition to what Elon said, about 4680, what 4680 did for us from a supply chain perspective was help us understand the supply chain that's upstream of our cell suppliers. So a lot of the deals that we had struck for 4680, we can also supply those materials to our partners, help reducing the overall cost back to Tesla. So we're basically inserting ourselves in the upstream supply chain by doing that. So that's also been beneficial in reducing the overall pricing in addition to the excess capacity that these suppliers have.
Elon Musk: Yes. No, I mean this is going to wax and wane, obviously. So there's going to be a boom and bust in battery cell production where production exceeds supply and then supply exceeds production and back and forth kind of like, I don't know, DRAM or something. But Yes. So it's like what is true today will not be true in the future, there's going to be somewhat of a boom and bust cycle here. And then there are additional complications with government incentives like the Inflation Reduction Act, the IRA, Joe [ph] has found like a funny name.
Vaibhav Taneja: Comical name.
Elon Musk: Yes, it is like Irish Republican Army, The Internet Research Agency from Russia.
Vaibhav Taneja: Independent retirement account.
Elon Musk: Yes, exactly. Roth IRA. It's like Spider-Man situation, which IRA wins. So but it is complicate the incentive structure. So that is there's the stronger demand for cells that are produced in the U.S. than outside the U.S. But then how long is that the IRA last, I don't know.
Vaibhav Taneja: Which is why it's important that we have both internet [ph] cells and vendor cells that hedge against all of this.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you very much. That's all the time we have today. But at the same time, I would like to make a short announcement. And I wanted to let the investment community know that about a month ago, I met up with Elon and Vaibhav and announced that I'll be moving on from the world of Investor Relations. I'll be hanging around for another couple of months or so. So feel free to reach out at any time. But after the seven year sprint, I'm going to be taking a break and spending some good quality time with my family. And I wanted to say that these seven years have been the greatest privilege of my professional life. I'll never forget the memories from I started literally at the beginning of production hell and just watching the company from the inside to see what it's become today. And especially super thankful to the people in this room and dozens of people outside of this room that I've worked for over the years. I think the team's strength and teamwork at Tesla is unlike anything else I've seen in my career. Elon, thank you very much for this opportunity that I got back in 2017. Thank you for seeking investor feedback and regularly and debating it with me.
Elon Musk: Yes. Well, I mean the reason I reached out to you was because I thought your analysis of Tesla was the best that I had seen.
Martin Viecha: Thank you.
Elon Musk: So, thank you for helping Tesla to get to where it is today over seven years. It's been a pleasure working with you.
Martin Viecha: Thank you so much. And yes, thank you for all the thousands of shareholders that we've met over the years and walked around factories and loved all the interactions, even the tough ones. And yes, looking forward to the call in the next three months, but I'll be on the other side, listening in. Thank you very much.
Vaibhav Taneja: Thanks."
401,TSLA,2,2024,2024-07-24 01:45:26,"Travis Axelrod: Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Tesla's Second Quarter 2024 Q&A Webcast. My name is Travis Axelrod, Head of Investor Relations and I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives. Our Q2 results were announced at about 3.00 p.m. Central Time and the Update Deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. Before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?
Elon Musk: Thank you. So to recap, we saw large adoption exploration in EVs, and then a bit of a hangover as others struggle to make compelling EVs. So there are quite a few competing electric vehicles that have entered the market. And mostly they’ve not done well, but they’ve discounted their EVs very substantially, which has made it a bit more difficult for Tesla. We don’t see this as long-term issue, but really -- fairly short-term. And we still obviously firmly believe that EVs are best for customers and that the world is headed for a fully electrified transport, not just the cars, but also aircrafts and boats. Despite many challenges the Tesla team did a great job executing and we did achieve record quarterly revenues. Energy storage deployments reached an all-time high in Q2, leading to record profits for the energy business. And we are investing in many future projects, including AI training and inference and great deal of infrastructure to support future products. We won't get too much into the product roadmap here, because that is reserved for product announcement events. But we are on track to deliver a more affordable model in the first half of next year. The big -- really by far the biggest differentiator for Tesla is autonomy. In addition to that, we've scale economies and we're the most efficient electric vehicle producer in the world. So, this, anyway -- while others are pursuing different parts of the AI robotic stack, we are pursuing all of them. This allows for better cost control, more scale, quicker time to market, and a superior product, applying not to -- not just to autonomous vehicles, but to autonomous humanoid robots like Optimus. Regarding Full Self-Driving and Robotaxi, we've made a lot of progress with Full Self-Driving in Q2 and with version 12.5 beginning rollout, we think customers will experience a step change improvement in how well supervised full self-driving works. Version 12.5 has 5x the parameters of 12.4 and will finally merge the highway and city stacks. So the highway stack is still at this point is pretty old. So often the issues people encounter are on highway, but with 12.5, we are finally merged the two stacks. I still find that most people actually don't know how good the system is, and I would encourage anyone to understand the system better, to simply try it out and let the car drive you around. One of the things we're going to be doing just to make sure people actually understand the capabilities of the car is when delivering a new car and when picking up a car for service to just show people how to use it and just drive them around the block. Once people use it at all they tend to continue using it. So it's very compelling. And then this I think will be a massive demand driver, even unsupervised full self-driving will be a massive demand driver. And as we increase the miles between intervention, it will transition from supervised full self-driving to unsupervised full self-driving, and we can unlock massive potential in [V3] (ph). We postponed the sort of Robotaxi the sort of product unveil by a couple of months where it were -- it shifted to 10/10 to the 10th October -end because I wanted to make some important changes that I think would improve the vehicle -- sort of Robotaxi, the thing that we are -- the main thing that we are going to show and we are also going to show off a couple of other things. So moving it back a few months allowed us to improve the Robotaxi as well as add in a couple other things for the product unveil. We're also nearing completion of the South expansion of Giga Texas, which will house our largest training cluster to date. So it will be an incremental for 50,000 H100s plus 20,000 of our hardware 4 AI5 Tesla AI computer. With Optimus, Optimus is already performing tasks in our factory. And we expect to have Optimus production Version 1 in limited production starting early next year. This will be for Tesla consumption. It's just better for us to iron out the issues ourselves. But we expect to have several thousand Optimus robots produced and doing useful things by the end of next year in the Tesla factories. And then in 2026, ramping up production quite a bit, and at that point we'll be providing Optimus robots to outside customers. That will be Production Version 2 of Optimus. For the energy business, this is growing faster than anything else. This is -- we are really demand constrained rather than production constrained. So we are ramping up production in our U.S. factory as well as building the Megapack factory in China that should roughly double our output, maybe more than double -- maybe triple potentially. So in conclusion, we are super excited about the progress across the board. We are changing the energy system, how people move around, how people approach the economy. The undertaking is massive, but I think the future is incredibly bright. I really just can't emphasize just the importance of autonomy for the vehicle side and for Optimus. Although the numbers sound crazy, I think Tesla producing at volume with unsupervised FSD essentially enabling the fleet to operate like a giant autonomous fleet. And it takes the valuation, I think, to some pretty crazy number. ARK Invest thinks, on the order of $5 trillion, I think they are probably not wrong. And long-term Optimus, I think, it achieves a valuation several times that number. I want to thank the Tesla team for a strong execution and looking forward to exciting years ahead.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you very much, Elon, and Vaibhav has opening remarks as well.
Vaibhav Taneja: Thanks. As Elon mentioned, the Tesla team rose to the occasion yet again and delivered on all fronts with some notable records. In addition to those records, we saw our automotive deliveries go sequentially. I would like to thank the entire Tesla team for their efforts in delivering a great quarter. On the auto business front, affordability remains a top of mind for customers, and in response in Q2, we offered attractive financing options to offset sustained high interest rates. These programs had an impact on revenue per unit in the quarter. These impacts will persist into Q3 as we have already launched similar programs. We are now offering extremely competitive financing rates in most parts of the world. This is the best time to buy a Tesla, I mean, if you are waiting on the sidelines, come out and get your car. We had a record quarter on regulatory credits, revenues, and as well. On net, our auto margins remained flat sequentially. It is important to note that the demand for regulatory credits is dependent on other OEMs plans for the kind of vehicles they are manufacturing and selling as well as changes in regulations. We pride ourselves to be the company with the most American-made cars and are continuing our journey to further localize our supply chain, not just in the U.S., but in Europe and China as well for the respective factories. As always, our focus is on providing the most compelling products at a reasonable price. We have stepped up our efforts to provide more trims that have estimated range of more than 300 miles on a single charge. We believe this, along with the expansion of our supercharging network, is the right strategy to combat range anxiety. Since the revision of FSD pricing in North America, we've seen production rates increase meaningfully and expect this to be a driver of vehicle sales as the feature set improves further. Cost per vehicle declined sequentially when we removed the impact of Cybertruck. While we are experiencing material costs trending down, note that there is latency on the cost side and such reductions would show up in the P&L when the vehicles built with these materials get delivered. Additionally, as we get into the second half of the year, it is important to note that we are still ramping Cybertruck and Model 3 and are also getting impacted by varying amounts of tariffs on both raw materials and finished goods. While our teams are working feverishly to offset these, unfortunately it may have an impact on the cost in the near-term. We previously talked about the potential of the energy business and now feel excited that the foundation that was laid over time is bearing the expected results. Energy storage deployments more than doubled with contribution not just from Megapack, but also Powerwall, resulting in record revenues and profit for the energy business. Energy storage backlog is strong. As discussed before, deployments will fluctuate from period to period with some quarters seeing large increases and others seeing a decline. Recognition of storage gigawatt hours is dependent on a variety of factors, including logistics timing as we send units from a single factory to markets across the world, customer readiness and in case of EPC projects on construction activities. Moving on to the other parts of the business, service and other gross profits also improved sequentially from the improvement in service utilization and growth in our collision repair business. The impact of our recent reorg is reflected in restructuring other - on the income statement. Just to level set, this was about $622 million of charge, which got recorded in the period. And I want people to remember that we've called it out separately on the financials. Sequentially, our operating expenses excluding surcharges reduced despite an increase in spend for AI-related activities and higher legal and other costs. On the CapEx front, while we saw a sequential decline in Q2, we still expect the year to be over $10 billion in CapEx as we increase our spend to bring a 50k GPU cluster online. This new cluster will immensely increase our capabilities to scale FSD and other AI initiatives. We reverted to positive free cash flow of $1.3 billion in Q2. This was despite restructuring payments being made in the quarter and we ended the quarter with over $30 billion of cash and investments. Once again, we've begun the journey towards the next phase for the company with the building blocks being placed. It will take some time, but will be a rewarding experience for everyone involved. Once again, I would like to thank the entire Tesla team for their efforts.
A - Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you very much, Vaibhav. Now let's go to investor questions. The first question is, what is the status on the Roadster?
Elon Musk: With respect to Roadster, we've completed most of the engineering. And I think there's still some upgrades we want to make to it, but we expect to be in production with Roadster next year. It will be something special, like the whole thing [Indiscernible].
Travis Axelrod: Fantastic. The next question is about timing of Robotaxi event, which we've already covered. So we'll go to the next question, when do you expect the first Robotaxi ride?
Elon Musk: I guess that, that's really just a question of when can we expect the first -- or when can we do unsupervised full self-driving. It's difficult, obviously, my predictions on this have been overly optimistic in the past. So I mean, based on the current trend, it seems as though we should get miles between interventions to be high enough that -- to be far enough in excess of humans that you could do unsupervised possibly by the end of this year. I would be shocked if we cannot do it next year. So next year seems highly probable to me based on [quite simply] (ph) plus the points of the curve of miles between intervention. That trend exceeds humans for sure next year, so yes.
Travis Axelrod: Thank you very much. Our third question is, the Cybertruck is an iconic product that wows everyone who sees it. Do you have plans to expand the cyber vehicle lineup to a cyber SUV or cyber van?
Elon Musk: I think we want to limit product announcements to when we have a special -- specific product announcement event, rather than earnings calls.
Travis Axelrod: Great, thank you. Our next question is, what is the current status of 4680 battery cell production and how is the ramp up progressing?
Lars Moravy: Yes, 4680 production ramped strongly in Q2, delivering 51% more cells than Q1 while reducing COGS significantly. We currently produce more than 1,400 Cybertrucks of 4680 cells per week, and we'll continue to ramp output as we drive cost down further towards the cost parity target we set for the end of the year. We've built our first validation Cybertruck with dry cathode process made on our mass production equipment, which is a huge technical milestone and we're super proud of that. We're on track for production launch with dry cathode in Q4, and this will enable cell cost to be significantly below available alternatives, which was the original goal of the 4680 program.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you very much. The next question is any update on Dojo?
Elon Musk: Yes, so Dojo, I should preface this by saying I'm incredibly impressed by NVIDIA's execution and the capability of their hardware. And what we are seeing is that the demand for NVIDIA hardware is so high that it's often difficult to get the GPUs. And there just seems this, I guess I'm quite concerned about actually being able to get state-of-the-art NVIDIA GPUs when we want them. And I think this therefore requires that we put a lot more effort on Dojo in order to have -- in order to ensure that we've got the training capability that we need. So we are going to double down on Dojo, and we do see a path to being competitive with NVIDIA with Dojo. And I think we kind of have no choice because the demand for NVIDIA is so high and the -- it's obviously their obligation essentially to raise the price of GPUs to whatever the market will bear, which is very high. So, I think we've really got to make Dojo work and we will.
Travis Axelrod: Right. The next question is what type of accessories will be offered with Optimus?
Elon Musk: There's -- Optimus is intended to be a generalized humanoid robot with a lot of intelligence. So it's like saying what kind of accessories will be offered with a human. It's just really intended to be able to be backward compatible with human tasks. So it would use any accessories that a human would use. Yes.
Travis Axelrod: Thank you. The next question is, do you feel you're cheating people out of the joys of owning a Tesla by not advertising?
Elon Musk: We are doing some advertising, so, want to say something?
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes, I would say something. Our fundamental belief is that we need to be providing the best products at a reasonable price to the consumers. Just to give you a fact, in U.S. alone in Q2, over two-thirds of our sales were to -- deliveries were to people who had never owned a Tesla before and which is encouraging. We've spent money on advertising and other awareness programs and we have adjusted our strategy. We're not saying no to advertising, but this is a dynamic play and we know that we have not exhausted all our options and therefore plan to keep adjusting, but in the latter half of this year as well.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you very much. The next question is on energy growth, which we already covered in opening remarks, so we'll move on to the next one. What is the updated timeline for Giga Mexico and what will be the primary vehicles produced initially?
Elon Musk: Well, we currently are paused on Giga Mexico. I think we need to see just where things stand after the election. Trump has said that he will put heavy tariffs on vehicles produced in Mexico. So it doesn't make sense to invest a lot in Mexico if that is going to be the case. So we kind of need to see where the things play out politically. However, we are increasing capacity at our existing factories quite significantly. And I should say that the Cybertaxi or Robotaxi will be produced here at our headquarters at Giga Texas.
Travis Axelrod: All right. Thank you.
Elon Musk: And as well Optimus towards the end of next year for Optimus production Version 2, the high volume version of Optimus will also be produced here in Texas.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thank you. Just a couple more. Is Tesla still in talks with an OEM to license FSD?
Elon Musk: There are a few major OEMs that have expressed interest in licensing Tesla full self-driving. And I suspect there will be more over time. But we can't comment on the details of those discussions.
Travis Axelrod: All right. Thank you. And the last one, any updates on investing in xAI and integrating Grok into Tesla software?
Elon Musk: I should say Tesla is learning quite a bit from xAI. It's been actually helpful in advancing full self-driving and in building up the new Tesla data center. With -- regarding investing in xAI, I think, we need to have a shareholder approval of any such investment. But I'm certainly supportive of that if shareholders are, the group -- probably, I think we need a vote on that. And I think there are opportunities to integrate Grok into Tesla's software, yes.
Travis Axelrod: All right. Thanks very much. And now we will move on to analyst questions. The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist. Will, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
Will Stein: Great. Thanks so much for taking my question. And this relates a little bit to the last one that was asked. Elon, I share your strong enthusiasm about AI and I recognize Tesla's opportunity to do some great things with the technology. But there are some concerns I have about Tesla's commercialization and that's what I'd like to ask about specifically. There were some news stories through the quarter that indicated that you redirected some AI compute systems that were destined for Tesla instead to xAI or perhaps it was to X, I'm not sure. And similarly, a few quarters ago, if you recall, I asked about your ability to hire engineers in this area, and you noted that there was a great desire for some of these engineers to work on projects that you were involved with, but some of them weren't at Tesla, they were instead at xAI or perhaps even X again. So the question is, when it comes to your capital investments, your AI R&D, your AI engineers, how do you make allocation decisions among these various ventures and how do you make Tesla owners comfortable that you're doing it in a way that really benefits them? Thank you.
Elon Musk: Yes, I mean, I think you're referring to a very -- like an old article, regarding GPUs. I think that's like 6 or 7 months old. At Tesla, we had no place to try them on, so it would've been a waste of Tesla capital because we would just have to order H100 and have no place to try them on. So it was just -- there was -- this wasn't a, let's pick xAI of Tesla. There's -- there was no -- the Tesla data centers were full. There was no place to actually put them. The -- we've been working 24/7 to complete the South extension on the Tesla Giga factory in Texas. That South extension is what will house 50,000 H100s and we're beginning to move the H100 server racks into place there. But we really needed -- we needed that to complete physically. You can't just order compute -- order GPUs and turn them on, you need a data center, it's not possible. So I want to be clear, that was in Tesla's interest, not contrary to Tesla's interest. Does Tesla no good to have GPUs that it can't turn on. That South extension is able to take GPUs, which is really just this week. We are moving the GPUs in there and we'll bring them online. With regard to xAI, there are a few that only want to work on AGI. So what I was finding was that when trying to recruit people to Tesla, they were only interested in working on AGI and not on Tesla's specific problems and they want to start -- do a start-up. So it was a case of either they go to a start-up or -- and I am involved or they do a start-up and I am not involved. Those are the two choices. This wasn't they would come to Tesla. They were not going to come to Tesla under any circumstances. So, yes.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes, I mean, I would even add that AI is a broad spectrum and there are a lot of things which we are focused on full time driving as Tesla and also Optimus, but there's the other spectrum of AI which we're not working on, and that's the kind of work which other companies are trying to do in this case, xAI. So you have to keep that in mind that it's a broad spectrum. It's not just one specific thing.
Elon Musk: Yes. And once again, I want to just repeat myself here. I tried to recruit them to Tesla, including to say like, you can work on AGI, I if you want and they refused. Only then was xAI created.
Will Stein: I really appreciate that clarification. If I can ask one follow-up, it relates to the new vehicles that you're planning to introduce next year. I understand this is not the venue for product announcements, but when we think about the focus, I've heard on the one hand that the focus is on cost reduction. On the other hand, you also said that the Roadster would come out. Should we expect other maybe more limited variants like, similar to the cars that you make today, but with some changes or improvements or different, some other variability in the form factors. It should -- we expect that to be a significant part of the strategy in the next year or two?
Elon Musk: I don't want to get into details of product announcements. And we have to be careful of the Osborne effect here. So, if you start announcing some great thing, it affects our near-term sales. We're going to make great products in future just like we have in the past, end of story.
Travis Axelrod: Right. The next question comes from Ben Kallo from Baird. Ben, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
Ben Kallo: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. When we think about revenue contribution and with energy growing so quickly and Optimus on the come, how do we think about the overall segments longer term? And then do you think that auto revenue will fall below 50% of your overall revenue? And then my follow-up is just on the last call you talked about, distributed compute on your new hardware. Could you just update us and talk a little bit more about that, the timeline for it and how you would reward customers for letting you use their compute power and their cars? Thanks.
Elon Musk: Yes, I mean, as I've said a few times, I think the long-term value of Optimus will exceed that of everything else that Tesla combined. So, it's simply -- just simply consider the usefulness utility of a humanoid robot that can do pretty much anything you ask of it. I think everyone on earth is going to want one. There's 8 billion people on earth, so it's 8 billion right there. Then you've got, all of the industrial uses, which is probably at least as much, if not way more. So I suspect that the long-term demand for general purpose humanoid robots is in excess of 20 billion units. And Tesla is -- that has the most advanced humanoid robot in the world, and is also very good at manufacturing, which these other companies are not. And we've got a lot of experience -- with the most experienced with the world leaders in real world AI. So we have all of the ingredients. I think we are unique in having all of the ingredients necessary for large scale, high utility, generalized humanoid robots. That's why my rough estimate long-term is in accordance with the ARK [ph] Invest analysis of market cap on the order of $5 trillion for -- maybe more for autonomous transport, and it's several times that number for general purpose humanoid robots. I mean, at that point, I'm not sure what money even means, but in the benign AI scenario, we are headed for an age of abundance where there is no shortage of goods and services. Anyone can have pretty much anything they want. It's a wild -- very wild future we're heading for.
Ben Kallo: On the distributed compute?
Elon Musk: Yes, distributed compute, that seems like a pretty obvious thing to do. I think the -- where this distributed compute becomes interesting is with our next generation Tesla AI truck, which is hardware viable or what we're calling AI5, which is -- from the standpoint of inference capability comparable toB200 -- and a bit of B200. And we are aiming to have that in production at the end of next year and scale production in '26. So it just seemed like if you've got -- even if you've got autonomous vehicles that are operating for 50 or 60 hours a week, there's a 168 hours in a week. So you have somewhere above I think a 100 [indiscernible] net computing. I think we need a better word than GPU because GPU means graph express in unit. So there's a 100 hours plus per week of AI compute, AI advanced compute from the fleet, from the vehicles and probably some percentage from the humanoid robots that it would make sense to do distributed inference. And if you're -- if there's a fleet of at some point a 100 million vehicles with AI5 and beyond, because you have AI 6 and 7 and whatnot, and there may be billions of humanoid robots that is just a staggering amount of inference compute or that could be used for general purposes at computing. It doesn't have to be used for, the humanoid robot or for the car. So I think, that's just -- that -- that's a pretty obvious thing to say, like, well, it's more useful than having to do nothing.
Travis Axelrod: All right. Thank you. The next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper Alex. Alex, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
Alex Potter: Perfect. Thanks. I wanted to ask a question on FSD licensing. You mentioned that in passing previously, was just wondering if you can elaborate maybe on the mechanics of how that would work. I guess presumably this would not be some sort of simple plug and play proposition that presumably an OEM would need, I don't know, several years to develop its own vehicle platform that's based on FSD. I imagine they would need to adopt Tesla's electrical architecture, compute, sensor stack. So I, correct me if I'm sort of misunderstanding this, but if you had a cooperative agreement of some kind with another OEM, then presumably it would take you several years before you'd be able to recognize licensing revenue from that agreement. Is that the right way to think about that?
Elon Musk: Yes. The OEMs not real fast. There's not really a sensor suite, it's just cameras. But they would have to integrate our AI computer and have cameras with a 360 degree view. And at least the gateway, like the what talks to the internet, and communicates with the Tesla system, what that you need kind of a gateway computer too. So it's really gateway computer with the cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity, the Tesla AI computer, and seven cameras, or not cameras, again, a 360 degree view. But this will -- given the speed at which, the auto industry moves, it would be several years before you would see this in volume.
Alex Potter: Okay, good. That's more or less what I expected. So then the follow-up here is, if you did sign an FSD licensing agreement with another automaker, when do you think you would disclose that? Would you do it right when you signed the agreement or only after that multiple years has passed and the vehicle is ready to be rolled out? think it depends on the OEM. I guess we'd be happy either way. Yes, it depends on, what kind of arrangement we enter into. A lot of those things are, we are not resolved yet, so we'll make that determination as and when we get to that point.
Elon Musk: And the kind of deals that are obviously relevant are only if, some OEM is willing to do this in a million cars a year or something significant. It's not -- if it's like 10,000 or a 100,000 cars a year. We can just make that ourselves.
Travis Axelrod: All right, thank you. The next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays. Dan, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
Dan Levy: Hi, good evening. Thanks for taking the questions. First, wanted to start with a question on Shanghai. You've leveraged Shanghai as an export center really due its low cost, and that makes sense. But maybe you can just give us a sense of, of how the strategy changes, if at all, given, the implementation of tariffs in Europe. Also to what extent, your import of batteries from China into the U.S., how that might change given the tariffs. Thank you.
Elon Musk: Yes. I think I covered some part of it in my opening remarks, but just to give you a little bit more, just on the tariff side, the European authorities did sample certain other OEMs in the first round to establish the tariffs for cars being imported from China into Europe. While we were not picked up in our individual examination in the first round, they did pick us up in the second round. They visited our factory. They -- we worked with them, provided them all the information. As a result, we were adjusting our import strategy out of China into Europe. But -- and one other thing to note is in Q2 itself, we started building right hand from model wise out of Berlin and we also delivered it in U.K. And we're adjusting as needed, but we will keep adjust. We're still importing Model 3s into Europe, out of Shanghai. And we are still evaluating what is the best alternate manage all this just on the examination by the European authorities. Like I said, we cooperated with them. Well, we are confident that they, we should get a better rate than what they have imposed for now. But this is literally evolving and we are adjusting as fast as we can with this. It is -- I would also add that, because of this, you've seen the impact that Berlin is doing more imports into places like Taiwan as well as, U.K I just mentioned. So it will keep changing and we will keep adapting as we go about it.
Dan Levy: Great. Thanks. Yes, thank you. As a follow-up, wanted to ask about the Robotaxi strategy and specifically the shareholder deck here notes that the release is going to be -- one of the gating factors is regulatory approval. So maybe you could help us understand which regulations specifically are the ones that we should be looking for? Is it FMVSS, that's standard? And then to what extent does the strategy shift? You've done with FSD more of a nationwide, no boundary approach. Is the Robotaxi approach one that's more geofenced, so to speak, and is more driven by a state by state approach?
Elon Musk: I mean, our solution is a generalized solution like what everybody else has. They, if you see like Waymo has one of it, they have a very localized solution that requires high density mapping. It's not -- it's quite fragile. So, their ability to expand rapidly is limited. Our solution is a general solution that works anywhere. It would even work on a different earth. So if you're rendered a new Earth, it would work on a new earth. So it's -- there's this capability I think in our experience, once we demonstrate that something is safe enough or significantly safer than human. We are fine that regulators are supportive of deploying deployment of that capability. It's difficult to argue with if you -- if you've got a large number of -- yes, if you've got billions of miles that show that in the future unsupervised FSD is safer than human. What regulator could really stand in the way of that? They would -- they're morally obligated to approve. So I don't think regulatory approval will be a limiting factor. I should also say that the self-driving capabilities of this are deployed outside of North America are far behind that in, in North America. So with the -- with Version 12.5, and maybe a 12.6, but pretty soon we will ask for regular regulatory approval of the Tesla supervised FSD in Europe, China, and other countries. And I, I think we're likely to receive that before the end of the year, which will be a helpful demand driver in those regions obviously.
Travis Axelrod: Thank you. Just to …
Elon Musk: Go ahead, Travis.
Travis Axelrod: In terms of like, as Elon said, in terms of regulatory approval, the vehicles are governed by FMVSS in U.S., which is the same across all 50 states. The road rules are the same across all 50 states. So creating a generalized solution gives us the best opportunity to deploy in all 50 states, reasonably. Of course there are state and even local and municipal level regulations that may apply to, being a transportation company or deploying taxes. But as far as getting the vehicle on the road, that's all federal and that's very much in line with what you was just suggesting about the data and the vehicle itself.
Vaibhav Taneja: And to add to the technology point, the end-to-end network basically makes no assumption about the location. Like you could add data from different countries and it just like perform equally well there, just like almost like close to zero US specific, um, code in there. It's all just the data that comes from the U.S
Elon Musk: Yes. To, to that end of the show, it's like, we can go as humans to other countries and drive with some reasonable amount of assessment in those countries. And that's how you design the FSC software. Yes, exactly.
Travis Axelrod: Great. Thanks guys. The next question comes from George from Canaccord. George, please go ahead and unmute yourself.
George Gianarikas: Hi, everyone. Thank you for taking my questions. Maybe just to expand on the regulatory question for a second. And I could be comparing apples and oranges, but GM canceled their pedal less, wheel less vehicle. And according to the company this morning, their decision was driven by uncertainty about the regulatory environment. And from what we understand, and again, maybe I'm wrong here, but the Robotaxi that has been shown at least in images of the public is also pedal less and wheel less. Is there a different regulatory concern just if you deploy a vehicle like that that doesn't have pedal -- pedals or a wheel, and that may not be different from just regular FSD on a traditional Tesla vehicle. Thank you.
Elon Musk: Well, obviously the real reason that they cancel it is because GM can't make it work, not because the regulators, they're blaming regulators. That's misleading of them to do so, because Waymo is doing just fine in those markets. So it's just that their technology is not far.
George Gianarikas: Right. And maybe just as a follow-up, I think you mentioned, that FSD take rates were up materially after you reduced the price. Is there any way you can help us quantify what that means Exactly? Thank you.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes, we shared the [indiscernible] that there we've seen a meaningful increase. I don't want to get into specific because we started from a low base and -- but we are seeing encouraging results. And the key thing here is, like Elon said, you need to experience it because words can't describe it till the time we actually use it. And that's why we are trying to make sure that every time a car is getting delivered, people are being showed how this thing is working because when you see it working, you realize how great it is. I mean, just to give you one example, so again, there's a bias example, but I have a more than 20 mile commute into the factory almost every day. I have zero interventions on the latest stack, and the card just literally drives me over. And especially with the latest version wherein, we are also tracking your eye movement, the steering wheel lag is almost not there as long as you're not wearing sunglasses.
Elon Musk: Well, we are fixing the sunglasses thing. It's coming soon. So you will be able to drive -- you'll be able to have sunglasses on and have the car drive.
George Gianarikas: Yes.
Elon Musk: So -- but there's number of times I've talked with smart people who like live in New York or maybe downtown Boston and don't ever drive and then ask me about FSD, I'm like, you can just get a car and try it. And if you're not doing that, you have no idea what's going on.
Travis Axelrod: Thank you. The next question comes from Pierre from New Street. Pierre, please unmute yourself.
Ferragu Pierre: Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. So it's on Robotaxi again, and I completely get it that with a universal solution, we will get like regulatory approval, we'll get there eventually clicking up miles and compute, et cetera. And my question is more, how you think about deployments, because I'm still like, I'm thinking once you have a car that can drive everywhere, that can replace me, it can replace a taxi, but then to do the right hailing service, you need a certain scale. And that means a lot of cars on the road and so you need an infrastructure to just maintain the cars, take care of them, et cetera. And so my question is, are you already working on that? Do you have already an idea of what, like your plan to deploy looks like? And is that like a test Tesla only plan or are you looking at partners, local partners, global partners to do that? And I'll have a quick follow-up.
Elon Musk: Yes. This would just be the Tesla network. You just literally open the Tesla app and summon a car and resend a car to pick you up and take you somewhere. And you can -- our -- we'll have a fleet that's I don't know, on order of 7 million dedicated global autonomy soon. In the years come it'll be over 10 million, then over 20 million. This is immense scale. And the car is able to operate 24/7, unlike the human driver. So, the capability to -- like, if there's this basically instant scale with a software update. And now this is for a customer on fleet. So you can think of that as being a bit like Airbnb, like you can choose to allow your car to be used by the fleet, or cancel that and bring it back. It can be used by the fleet all the time. It can be used by the fleet some of the time, and then Tesla would take -- would share on the revenue with the customer. But you can think of the giant fleet of Tesla vehicles as like a giant sort of Airbnb equivalent fleet, Airbnb on wheels. The -- I mean, then in addition we would make some number of cars for Tesla that would just be owned by Tesla and be added to the fleet. I guess that would be a bit more like Uber. But this would all be a Tesla network. And there's an important clause we've put in, in every Tesla purchase, which is that the Tesla vehicles can only be used in the Tesla fleet. They cannot be used by a third-party for autonomy.
Ferragu Pierre: Okay. And do you think that scale is like progressively so you can start in a city with just a handful of cars and you grow the number of cars over time? Or do you think there is like a critical mass you need to get to, to be able to offer like a service that is of competitive quality compared to what like the -- like Uber would be typically delivering already?
Elon Musk: I guess I'm not -- maybe I'm not conveying this correctly. The entire Tesla fleet basically becomes active. This is obviously maybe there's some number of people who don't want their car to own money, but I think most people will. It's instant scale.
Travis Axelrod: Thank you. Our next question comes from Colin from Oppenheimer. Colin, please unmute yourself.
Colin Rusch: Sorry about that guys. I've got two questions around energy storage. With the tight supply and the stationary storage, can you talk about your pricing strategy and how you're thinking about saturation and given geographies given that some of these larger systems are starting to shift wholesale power markets in a pretty meaningful way quickly?
Vaibhav Taneja: So, I mean, we are working with a large set of players in the market and our pipeline is actually pretty long. And there's actually very -- there's actually long end in terms of where you enter into a contract where delivery started -- starts happening. And so far we have good pricing leverage. And now Mike, chime in on this too.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, I mean there's a lot of competition from Chinese OEMs just like there is in the vehicle space. So we're in close contact with our customers and making sure that we're remaining competitive in where they're needing to be competitive to, to secure contracts to sell power and energy in the markets. We had a really strong contracting quarter and continue to build our backlog for 2025 and 2026. So we feel pretty good about where we are in the market. We realize that competition is strong, but we have a pretty strong value proposition with offering a fully integrated product with our own power electronics and site level controls. So …
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes, and again, the aspect which people miss do not fully understand is that there's also a whole software stack, which comes with from Megapack, right? And that is a unique proposition which we -- which is only available to us, and we are using it with other stuff too, but that gives us a much more of an edge as compared to the competition.
Elon Musk: Yes, we find customers that they can sort of put together a hodgepodge solution. And so, and then sometimes they'll pick that solution, and then that doesn't work. And then they come back to us.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, and we're not really seeing saturation for like, on a global scale. There's little pockets of saturation in different markets, but we're more seeing that there's markets opening up given demand on the grid just continues to increase more than anyone expects. So that just opens up markets, really across the world in different pockets.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes, I mean just even on the AI computer side, right? These GPUs are really powerful already and the amount of new pipeline, which we're getting for people for data center backup and things like that is increasing at a pretty large scale.
Colin Rusch: Yes. Thanks. And then the follow-up here is 4680 process technology and the role to role process. There's some news around your equipment suppliers. Can you talk about how far along you are in, in potentially qualifying an incremental supplier around some of that, those critical process technology steps?
Lars Moravy: Yes, I can talk about that. As you're probably referring to the lawsuit that we have with one of our suppliers, look, I don't think this is going to affect our ability to roll out 4680. We have very strong IP position in the technology and the majority of the equipment that we use is in-house designed and some of it's in-house build. And so we can take our IP stack and have someone else build it if we need to. So it's, that's not really a concern right now.
Elon Musk: Yes. I, I think people don't understand just how much demand there will be for grid storage. They really just like the [indiscernible] I think are underestimating this demand by probably orders magnitude. So that the actual energy, total energy output of, say the U.S grid is if the power plants can operate a steady state is at least two to three times, the amount of energy it currently produces, because there are a huge gap. There's a huge difference in the -- from peak to trough in terms of energy of power generation. So in order for a grid to not have blackouts, it must be able to support the load at the worst minute of the worst day of the year, the coldest or hottest day, which means that for the rest of the time, the rest of the year, it's got massive excess power generation capability, but it has no way to store that energy. Once you add battery packs, you can now run the power plants at steady state. Steady state means that basically any given grid anywhere in the world can produce in terms of cumulative energy in the course of the year, at least twice what it is currently producing in some cases, maybe three times.
Travis Axelrod: All right. Thank you, Elon. The next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo. Colin, please unmute yourself.
Colin Langan: Oh, great. Thanks for taking my questions. Do you hear me?
Travis Axelrod: Yes.
Colin Langan: Yes. Sorry. I guess when we are going to ask, if Trump wins, there's a higher chance that IRA could get cut. I think Elon, you had commented online that Tesla doesn't survive on EV subsidies. But when Tesla lose a lot of support if IRA goes away? I think model Y3 and Y get IRA help for customers, and I think your batteries get production tax credits. So, just one, can you clarify if the end, if IRA ends, would it be a negative for your profitability in the near-term? Why might it not be a negative? And then, any framing of the current support you get, IRA-related?
Elon Musk: I guess that there would be like some impact, but I think it would be devastating for our competitors. But -- and it would hurt Tesla slightly. But long-term probably actually helps Tesla would be my guess. Yes -- but I've said this before on earnings calls, it -- the value of Tesla overwhelmingly is autonomy. These other things are in the noise relative to autonomy. So I recommend anyone who doesn't believe that Tesla will solve vehicle autonomy should not hold Tesla stock. They should sell their Tesla stock. You should believe Tesla will solve autonomy, you should buy Tesla stock. And all these other questions are in the noise.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes, I mean, I'll add this just to clarify a few things that -- at the end of the day, when we are looking at our business, we've always been looking at it whether or not IRA is there and we want our business to grow healthy without having any subsidies coming in, whichever way you look at it. And that's the way we have always modeled everything. And that is the way internally also even when we are looking at battery costs, yes, I --, there are manufacturing credits which we get, but we always drive ourselves to say, okay, what if there is no higher benefit and how do we operate in that kind of an environment? And like Elon said, we definitely have a big advantage as compared to a competition on that front. We've delivered it and you can see it in the numbers over the years. Like, so there is you cannot ignore the fundamental size of the business. And then on top of it, once you add autonomy to it, like even said, it becomes meaningless to you think about the short-term.
Travis Axelrod: Okay. I think that's unfortunately all the time we have for today. We appreciate all of your questions. We look forward to talking to you next quarter. Thank you very much and goodbye.
Elon Musk: That's excellent."
675,TSLA,1,2023,2023-04-19 18:54:06,"Martin Viecha: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's First Quarter 2023 Q&A Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn, and a number of other executives. Our Q1 results were announced at about 3:00 P.M. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?
Elon Musk: Thank you, Martin. So just a Q1 recap. Model Y became the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Europe and the best-selling non-pickup vehicle in the United States. And this is in spite of a lot of challenges in production and delivery. So it's a huge credit to the Tesla team for achieving these great results. The -- it is worth pointing out that the current macro environment remains uncertain. I don't think I'm telling anyone anything, I think people already know, especially with large purchases such as cars. And while we reduced prices considerably in early Q1, it's worth noting that our operating margin remains among the best in the industry. We've taken a view that pushing for higher volumes and a larger fleet is the right choice here versus a lower volume and higher margin. However, we expect our vehicles, over time, will be able to generate significant profit through autonomy. So we do believe we're like laying the groundwork here, and then it's better to ship a large number of cars at a lower margin, and subsequently, harvest that margin in the future as we perfect autonomy. This is an extremely important point. Let's see. Regarding the Cybertruck, we continue to build Alpha versions of the Cybertruck on our pilot line for testing purposes. It's a great product, and we're completing the installation of the volume production line at Giga Texas, and we're anticipating having delivery event, a great delivery event probably in Q3. As with all new products, it will follow an S curve, so production starts out slow and then accelerates. So the Cybertruck is no different. So it's -- there's [Indiscernible] amount of demand for the product, obviously. And it is my view, a fantastic product, a hall of famer. But as with all new products, it takes time to get the manufacturing line going. And this is really a very radical product. It's not made in the way that other cars are made. So with regard to Megapack, we're making great progress. Our energy storage deployment reached nearly 4 gigawatt hours in Q1. This is, by far, the strongest quarter ever. And this growth was achieved thanks to the ongoing ramp at our Mega factory in Lathrop, California. There's still some way to go to reach the [Indiscernible] rate of 40 gigawatt hours per year. And then we additionally announced the start of a new Mega factory in Shanghai. So we're -- as we've expected, the stationary storage growth actually will significantly exceed the vehicle growth. Regarding Autopilot and Full Self-Driving, we've now crossed over 150 million miles driven by Full Self-Driving beta, and this number is growing exponentially. We're -- I mean, this is a data advantage that really no one else has. Those who understand AI will understand the importance of data -- of training data and how fundamental that is to achieving an incredible outcome. So, yes, so we're also very focused on improving our neural net training capabilities as is one of the main limiting factors of achieving full autonomy. So, we're continuing to simultaneously make significant purchases of NVIDIA GPUs and also putting a lot of effort into Dojo, which we believe has the potential for an order of magnitude improvement in the cost of training. And it also -- Dojo also has the potential to become a sellable service that we would offer to other companies in the same way that Amazon Web Services offers web services, even though it started out as a bookstore. So, I really think that, yes, the Dojo potential is very significant. In conclusion, we're taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can. Despite this being an uncertain macro environment, this is a good time to increase our lead further, and we'll continue to invest in growth as fast as possible. Once again, I'd like to give a huge thanks to all Tesla employees worldwide who are doing an incredible job again. And yes, super appreciated.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. And Zach has some remarks as well.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Thanks Martin. I want to start by congratulating the Tesla team for record vehicle production and deliveries. And I also want to congratulate our energy storage team for record volumes as well. There's three main points I want to make. First, automotive gross margin and operating margin reduced sequentially. But as Elon mentioned, these remain at healthy levels. In particular, automotive gross margin was impacted by a few factors since our discussion on the last earnings call, which include additional action taken in the second half of the quarter to improve vehicle pricing and one-time items, most notably warranty adjustments on older S and X vehicles as well as increased deferred revenue for certain Autopilot features as we transition technologies. Progress on vehicle cost reduction continued in Q1 with meaningful improvements on logistics and the beginnings of some commodity cost reductions starting to be realized. Per unit cost for Austin and Berlin improved as well, driven by record volumes. However, these factories still provide a margin headwind and will likely continue to do so until after we reach and stabilize at our intended volumes. Note that Q1 was our third quarter in our multi-quarter plan to move to a more regionally balanced mix of build and deliveries. As I've mentioned previously, this results in lower deliveries and production within a quarter due to a higher volume of cars in transit at the end of the quarter and has an associated impact on quarter-ending free cash flows. This was particularly prevalent in Q1 for S and X as we begin exporting cars for international deliveries. Second, our storage business is starting to take shape, and this is exciting to see after many years of investment and focus. This business is growing as a percentage of the businesses of the company's revenue and reached its highest level yet in Q1, driven by an increasing rate of deliveries for our Megapack products. We are also making progress on storage profitability, generating our highest gross profit yet in the quarter. Third, I want to reiterate the philosophy by which we're operating the business this year. Our approach is to grow volumes as quickly as possible in both our vehicle and energy businesses. We plan to continue to invest heavily into our future plans, which include the Cybertruck next-generation platform, in-house cell production, energy storage business and our autonomy and AI-enabled products. And we plan to do this while keeping the business financially healthy and industry leading. To accomplish this, we need to remain focused on cost efficiency and working capital and in particular, unwinding the strategic inventory buildup left over from the pandemic. I want to conclude by thanking the Tesla team again, as well as thanking our suppliers and our customers.
A - Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. And let's go to investor questions on say.com. The first one is what is the process to make auto pricing adjustments? What variables do you consider? How frequently do you review pricing?
Zachary Kirkhorn: Do you want to take that, Elon, or do you want me to take that?
Elon Musk: My apologies. Sorry, I was on mute. Yeah, I think this is not something that we can really talk about. It's just -- we do our best to evaluate the production output, macroeconomic conditions, and we make a decision. But it's -- and unless there's something you'd like to add, Zach.
Zachary Kirkhorn: I think that's right. I mean, as a team, we review where we stand globally on a weekly basis and certainly, I can't get into the details of the reasons why certain decisions are made. But it is something that's very actively managed by a subset of the leadership team.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The second question is, do you still believe Tesla Energy will be bigger than auto? And when will you provide more formal guidance on Megapack and overall Tesla Energy?
Elon Musk: Yes, I should just clarify like bigger than auto from the standpoint of like total gigawatt hours deployed. So its possible automotive revenue may be higher, but gigawatt hours I think will be probably higher with stationary storage. If you just look at the -- what's needed to transition the world to a sustainable energy economy, there is more stationary energy storage needed than there is mobile energy storage. So -- and we are seeing growth of our stationary storage well in excess of automotive. So that is in line with expectations.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yeah. And on the guidance part of the question, and maybe, Martin, we can combine this with the next question, which is on guidance for margins, just have a single comment there. I think we are -- we will get to the point where we, as a company, provide guidance on the storage business. I say storage is a combination of both the Megapack business and the Powerwall business. Relative to total revenues of the company, it's still fairly small. And the business has a lot of volatility currently, both in terms of volumes as well as financials just given the small volumes and diversification of the customer pool there. But as this business grows and smooths out, I don't think we're that far away from it. I think including these volumes on our day two production and deliveries release is something that we'll start doing and then we can talk more formally as a business about our expectations over the coming year. I think it will be a few more quarters before we get there.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question, as you said, was already answered, so let's go to the battery question.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Sorry. Just one other thing I wanted to mention on margin. While we're not providing specific guidance there, I mean, just to set expectations of where we think this business will go in terms of margins, probably generally in the ballpark of what we've seen historically on the vehicle business. We generally look to mid-20% gross margins for any program that we launch. And so we're not there yet on this business, but that's what we're working towards.
Elon Musk: We're hopeful to get there later this year, but that's not a promise. That's an aspiration.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, how well are 4680 cells meeting the expectations described on the Battery Day? How long will it be until the cells meet those goals? Drew?
Andrew Baglino: Yeah. So on Battery Day, we established a cost-down road map through 2026 across five areas of effort. There was the cell design we discussed, anode and cathode materials, the structural pack concept, and the cell factory itself, and we've been making progress across all of these aspects since then. For the cell factory, the Texas 4680 factory are partway through building and commissioning and selling and operating will be 70% lower CapEx per gigawatt hour than typical cell factories when fully ramped, in line with what we described on Battery Day. And we're continuing to further pursue densification and investment reduction opportunities in future factory build-outs like in Nevada. On the cell design, we're in production with not only the first generation tablet cell we unveiled on Battery Day, but a second more manufactural version in Texas today. On the cathode materials side, we have a number of activities underway per the Battery Day road map. For lithium, our Corpus Christi Lithium refinery breaks ground this May. Our goal is to start commissioning portions of the facility before the end of the year. The refinery uses the sulfate-free spodumene refining process with reduced process costs, no acid or caustic reagents, lower embodied energy. It actually produces a beneficial byproduct that can be repurposed in construction materials. We discussed all of these concepts on Battery Day. Same with cathode precursor, we've successfully demonstrated lower process cost, zero waste water precursor process that we described on Battery Day at both lab and pilot scale and are in the detailed design phase for incorporating this technology into the front end of our Austin cathode facility. On cathode production, we are 50% equipment and 75% utilities installed at our new cathode building in Austin, with our goal to begin dry and wet commissioning this quarter and next quarter with a target to produce first material before the end of the year. Structural pack, we saw big improvements with pack manufacturing with the 4680 cell and the structural pack concept, 50% lower CapEx and 66% smaller factory for the same output in gigawatt hours per year. We do believe structural as a concept is a good one. It's simpler. We'll continue to structurally load the cells and use the pack as the floor of the vehicle while iterating the design to closer to B-level execution of this A-level architecture in future programs. And zooming out for the 4680 team, Q1 was all about cost and quality. We made significant improvements in both areas. Texas production increased 50% quarter-over-quarter through yields increased 12% and [Indiscernible] peak rate increased by 20% and through yields improved by 20%. Altogether, the team accomplished a 25% reduction in COGS over the quarter, and we are on track to achieve steady-state cost targets over the next 12 months. And going forward for the rest of the year, the priority, one, is yielding cost for the 4680 program as we steadily ramp production ahead of Cybertruck next year.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. The next question is, what do you anticipate 2023 automotive gross margins ex credits will be at the company's current pricing levels?
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes, I can start off on this one. This is a difficult environment to make a projection like this. There's a lot of macro uncertainty. There's also headwinds and tailwinds. And this is basically a question I think that's asking about viewpoint on where costs will go. And within costs, there's a set of costs in which we do control and a set of costs in which we're kind of subject to what's going on in the macro world. Within the bucket of things we control, most of the cost down that we're working on is around ramping our Austin factory, stabilizing that and then doing the cost optimization work once we get to our intended volumes there. And a part of the cost journey in the Austin factory is, as Drew mentioned, the 4680 cell, which is an input into our Austin COGS. And so, as the 4680 program improves over the course of the year on cost, as Drew mentioned, and then the non-cell portion of the factory improves and we see a pretty good trajectory in the Austin facility. A similar story exists in the Berlin factory. It does not have 4680 as an input, but for that factory, the journey to complete localization is still ongoing. And so, over the course of this year, as volume increases, more localization occurs, we do see a good path to cost reduction in the Berlin factory as well. In existing factories, we talk about this on every call, so I don't need to rehash it, but the expectation is that every existing factory improves all of their key metrics and we continue to see the progress there. There's also a handful of other costs in which we have influence, but the philosophy here is that, we're aggressively going across every cost bucket that we can. Within the world that we don't control, the two major costs there being logistics, which fortunately is moving in our favor, and I think our supply chain team has done a great job, both on logistics optimization and taking advantage of reduced spot rates where they can. So thank you to our supply chain team. And then there's the commodities world, which has been a huge pain point in our cost structure over the last, say, two years or so, and we're still kind of at the maximum of pain for commodities in our cost structure. It kind of maximize -- max down in the second half of last year. We did start to see, in Q1, a little bit of improvement. We think there'll be a little bit more improvement in Q2, but...
Elon Musk: Lithium has dropped a lot. It's worth mentioning that the price of lithium has dropped significantly.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. And that's the piece that we expect to see more impact on in Q2. And, generally, as a company, we do expect commodity prices to come down and have a more meaningful impact in the second half of the year.
Elon Musk: Yes.
Zachary Kirkhorn: So this is our approach. How that nets out, I mean, just a lot of risk, and we'll have to see how the year progresses.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, how has global order intake tracked since the most recent round of price cuts?
Elon Musk: I think the overall thing we can say is that orders are in excess of production.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. And maybe the last question from investors, can you give updated specs and pricing for Cybertruck and any new features that will make it to production?
Elon Musk: Well, I think we'll save that for the Cybertruck handover, which will hopefully be around the end of Q3 this year. And one thing I am confident of saying is that, it's an incredible product, it's a hall of famer, I think. And a product like this only comes once in a long while. So it will not be disappointed at all. It's amazing.
Martin Viecha : Great. Thank you very much. And let's go to analyst questions. We'll start with Alex Potter from Piper Sandler. Alex, go ahead and unmute.
Alex Potter: Can you hear me?
Martin Viecha : Yes.
Elon Musk: Yes.
Alex Potter: Okay. Perfect. So, first question was on Lathrop. Obviously, that's -- it's great to see the growth there. Just wondering when you think that facility might be closer to full utilization? Are you just sort of deliberately working your way up the S curve there? Demand, obviously, isn't the limitation. So what are what are the steps, I guess, to unlocking full utilization there?
Andrew Baglino: Sure. There are some classic factory ramp aspects of what's going on in Lathrop. We actually had two phases of the CapEx there. We phased some of the general assembly parts of the facility. But in addition, we also have ramps with our suppliers that we are following, so both on the sell side and on the power electronics side. And we will see that unlock in the latter half of this year with both those inputs. So the overall facility was phased with the second phase of CapEx coming online towards the end of this year.
Alex Potter: Okay. Great. And then I guess my second question is on your ability to serve other markets out of Shanghai. Obviously, the facility in Berlin should be opening up your ability to, I guess, allocate more vehicles to Southeast Asia, Australia, other areas. I'm just wondering what other regions do you think you're maybe not yet serving effectively? What are your timelines for addressing some of those gaps in your regional exposure? Thanks.
Elon Musk: Yes. That's a good question because there are still many parts of the world that we do not yet serve with respect to vehicles especially. So we do expect to open up new markets around the world. And while those markets are not necessarily individually gigantic, they do add up to add a whole bunch of markets. They do collectively sum up to something significant. So it's high time that Tesla operates its cars to the rest of the world, and that is something that we intend to do.
Martin Viecha : Okay. Thank you very much. Let's go to the next analyst, George from Canaccord. Go ahead and unmute.
George Gianarikas: Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, first, if you could discuss your FSD take rates and whether you've seen any significant positive or negative change there? And also, given that you've reduced the prices for your vehicles, do you think you need to do that for FSD as well? Thanks.
Elon Musk: Well, I can kind of answer the details on the FSD take rate, but the -- it's a tricky pricing question, because the value of a car that is autonomous is enormous. So in a way, the price right now is an option value on an autonomous vehicle. And that value is -- that will ultimately be very significant. And it's really -- yes. I mean, for those that are using the FSD beta, I think you can see the improvements are really quite dramatic. There'll be a little bit of two steps forward, one step back between releases for those trying the beta. But the trend is very clearly towards full self-driving, towards full autonomy. And I hesitate to say this, but I think we'll do it this year. So that's what it looks like. Yes.
George Gianarikas: Thank you. Maybe on the dramatic change we've seen in EV-related commodity prices. Do you think it's a reflection of any recent overcapacity in mining and refining, or is that sort of a coincident indicator on global EV demand? And how do you expect those prices to kind of track over the next several quarters? Thank you.
Elon Musk: Man, I wish I had a crystal ball to answer your question. I don't know if we can provide a question that would -- with -- that would have any value really. I think we're in uncertain times. And if somebody got a crystal ball they can lend me, I'd really like to borrow it. But these are uncertain times. My guess is this it's economic to me whether for about a year or so. And then if we hold roughly 12 months and then -- but this is my guess. It's just pure speculation. Stormy weather for about 12 months and then provided there are no major geopolitical wildcards that show up, that things start getting sunny around spring next year.
Andrew Baglino: The only thing I would say on the -- like EV materials markets. They're not all super liquid and some of them, for example, like less than -- like single-digit percentage of the market has actually traded on the spot market. And not only are they not super liquid, there's not -- like storage isn't particularly fast for all of materials. So like small mismatches in supply and demand drive, like large price wins, not really real price wins, but just like temporarily large price swings. So it's hard to read into those price wings. I don't know, Karn if you want to add anything.
Karn Budhiraj: Yes. Well, this is Karn, by the way. We are seeing, as Elon mentioned, quite a bit of softening in the lithium carbonate market. This was -- six months ago, we were trading at like $85,000 a ton, and today's spot price is about 26%. So there's been a dramatic decrease in that. Of course, we were able to take advantage of low lithium pricing earlier on with fixed price contracts. And we find that this is going to be another opportunity -- opportune moment to basically extend that into the later half of the decade. But we -- at the quantities we're procuring, we're not as impacted by the spot market because we have those contracts in place, and we're just going to be going and doing more of that. The other thing that's happening is because of the price spike, a lot of the companies that are in this business are becoming more ambitious about finding more upstream resources and exploring locations in Africa as well as South America. So that's also helping the macro situation with pricing.
Elon Musk: Yes. But just on the lithium front, to emphasize, the choke point is more -- much more on refining capacity than it is on mining. The theme is actually -- is very common throughout the world, including in the US and really never -- it's just a very common element on earth, is lithium. So, it's much more a question of where is the refining capacity and can the refining capacity keep up? That's really what matters more than where is the lithium ore. It's everywhere basically. I think that same question also extends to refining of the cathode and to some degree, refining of the anode. And this is why we, at Tesla, we're building our lithium refinery capability at Corpus Christi and our cathode refinery outside Austin. It's worth noting, I hope other companies do the same thing. We will have, by far, the most lithium refining capability and the most cathode refining capability in North America, I think, probably more than everyone else combined by a lot. So, can other people please do those work? That would be great. We're begging you. We don't want to do it. Can someone please? Like instead of making a picture-sharing app, please, we're trying, lithium, mining and refining, heavy industry, come on.
Karn Budhiraj: It's fun. It's actually fun.
Elon Musk: Yes, yes. Exactly. For real.
Zachary Kirkhorn: That's we're here, ready to buy.
Elon Musk: It's -- Tesla is not famous because we want to do it. We have a lot of fish to fry, obviously, but we're doing it because others aren't doing it, and we wish others would do it.
Martin Viecha: Awesome. Thank you very much. Let's go to Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.
Emmanuel Rosner: Can you hear me?
Martin Viecha: Yes, we can. Yes.
Emmanuel Rosner: Perfect. Thank you so much for taking my questions. Maybe a first question for Elon, on your pricing strategy. So, if I understand your message, you're saying Tesla feels it's worth maximizing the volume, increasing the size of the fleet as fast as you can because you'll be able to monetize this over the life cycle of the vehicle. Could you be a little bit more specific around ways you would be able to monetize sort of like this existing fleet in the future. Obviously, I think autonomous seems to be a big piece of it, but my understanding was that robotaxi would probably be for the next-generation vehicle, not the existing ones. So, I guess in which ways would you monetize it?
Elon Musk: Sorry, the robotaxi terminology can be a bit confusing because that's sort of like a generic term for our next-generation vehicle. And we obviously are working on next-generation vehicle. That's going to be very compelling. This is just not the time to talk about it in details product. So, we internally call it robotaxi. But really, all of the vehicles that have Hardware 3, which is the vast majority of our fleet, we believe will achieve full autonomy. So, there will be a like a Model 3 or Model Y would be a robotaxi, a robotic taxi. So, yes, that's -- to the best of my knowledge that we believe the current hardware can achieve full autonomy.
Emmanuel Rosner: Understood. And then maybe a question for Zach. Back on the automotive gross margins. So, I think, I guess, a few months ago, even after major price cuts, you felt pretty strongly that 20% automotive gross margin was still probably a reasonable floor. Obviously, the macro has gone worse and additional price cuts have happened. Is there anything else that has changed in terms of the outlook? Is it just the macro deteriorating? Is it the competitive landscape? Anything else that's sort of like makes you think differently around the full year? And is there a way, therefore, to frame a floor?
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yeah. About half of the miss against that previous conversation last quarter is attributed to adjustments we made in pricing in the second half of the quarter. I mean, I guess you could argue that that lowers the floor in a sense. We've also made pricing adjustments so far this quarter. So that brings it down further. About the other half of the miss in Q1 was attributed to things that are nonrecurring. So I mentioned these in my opening remarks. It's a warranty adjustment for cars that were previously produced but not part of the pedigree of cars we're building now and some autopilot-related deferrals as we make some technology changes here that this deferral should get recognized once some of the software catches up. So those two things are not repeating. So hopefully, that helps answer your question.
Elon Musk: Yeah. I mean there's really two macro factors that are tricky. The biggest being the interest rate. So if there's a very high Fed rate or interest rates are very high, that is -- every time the Fed raise the interest rates that's equivalent to increasing the price of a car. It makes the cars less affordable because people are able to buy cars as a function of what they can afford on a monthly basis. So that's -- so it's just almost directly equivalent to a price increase, is there any kind of interest rate increase. Then the other factor is whenever there is uncertainty in the economy, people will generally postpone new -- big, new capital purchases like a new car. This is a natural human reaction. So if people are reading about layoffs and whatnot in the press, they're like, well, they might be worried about -- they might be laid off. So then there'll be naturally a little more hesitant than they would otherwise be to buy a new car. Now this is just the nature of the auto industry. But there is -- there will be a trans amount of pent-up demand for new cars. So it goes through cycles.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to Ben Kallo from Baird. Ben go ahead and unmute.
Ben Kallo: Hey guys. When you talk about manifest supply, you talked about Dojo being a product that you can sell outside of Tesla. How do we rank all the things you have going on and then in the economic environment? I mean, like heat pumps and everything else you have going on versus investing in the vehicle business, or is that not the right way to look at it?
Elon Musk: I'm not sure I fully understand your question, but I'd look at Dojo as like kind of a long-shot bet, but if it's a long-shot bet that pays off, it will pay off in a very, very big way. But potentially, yeah, potentially in a very, very big way, Like in the multi-hundred billion dollar level. But I think it's like still put it in the long shot category, but long shot with a multi-hundred billion dollar potential outcome. And – so it's a bet worth making, but not one you can sort of say like or take it to the bank type of thing. Although, these days take it to the bank, it's maybe not as secure as it used to be. So obviously, big believes in heat pumps. And that is on all this that over time is to do a really good heat pump for homes and commercial offices and stuff. And we have the technology that's really good. But it's still – it's a back burner item. Our focus is very much on vehicles, autonomy, stationary storage, basically solving sustainable energy and solving autonomy, which would be like – solving autonomy, if we're able to have a fleet of several million vehicles that with a software update can be potentially worth several times their original value, that's – that will be – if that happens, that will be the – and I think it will happen, that will be the biggest asset value increase in history, I think.
Ben Kallo: Thank you. Moving to sort of pricing, but a lot of pundits talk about the pie and losing share or gaining share. But how do you guys look at pricing versus the EVs or price vehicles, or does that not come into the equation? Sorry to ask about pricing again. Thank you.
Elon Musk: No, it's really just like – every day, we get a daily real-time update of how many cars were ordered yesterday, how many cars were produced yesterday. We must have – if there's a company that's got more real-time data than Tesla – I'm not sure, there's any company on earth that has better real-time data than Tesla, except maybe SpaceX Starlink. So – because like we don't have to -- for the other car companies, they will make the cars, send them to the dealers then the dealers will sell the cars. And then it takes quite a long time for them to get the data back to actually figure out how many cars were sold. Whereas we know how many cars were ordered yesterday throughout the world. So our fingers on the pulse is real-time and does not have latency, whereas the other car companies have a lot of latency in their data. As does the government, the government has a lot of latency in their data. So we're just looking at and saying, okay, what does it take to achieve a clearing price for our vehicle production? And then we'll make a pricing change, and we see what happens immediately and adjust course. So we're adjusting course – and we're thinking about it literally every day, seven days a week. Every seven days, we collect that e-mail and so is the rest of the team. And we try to make the lease down decision that we can. And on balance, I think our decisions are pretty good. Sometimes they'll be down, but on average, they're, I think, better than the rest of the industry.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Just to add on the question about EV market share or ICE. This comes up a lot. I think a lot of the public debate is around this concept of EV market share. We don't look at it that way. I mean, we look at it as -- it's a car market and not the EV market. And actually, the mission of the company requires internal combustion engine cars to be switched over to electric vehicles. So that's what we pay attention to.
Elon Musk: Yes. I've said that last time, too. We got -- you guys got to stop looking at it as EV -- the EV market. Its how many cars are we selling, just start looking at it that way. All cars will be EVs. It's going to -- I've said this for a long time. We'll look back, I don't know, assuming civilization is still around in 20 years, we'll look back on internal combustion engine vehicles the same way we look back on external combustion engine vehicles, which is like the steam engine. A steam engine is an external combustion engine vehicle. And there's still a few around. They're kind of quirky and kind of cool collectors' items. That's how gasoline cars will be in the future.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer. Colin, go ahead. Unmute please.
Colin Rusch: Thanks so much, guys. Can you talk a little bit about how much of the actual cost structure is variable on these vehicles? And if you could give us a range on pulse or minus the lithium cost within those contracted volumes that you're seeing?
Elon Musk: Well, I think -- again, we'd really love to have a crystal ball here, but we don't have it. Depending on what time scale you're looking at, most of the car is variable. So most cost is variable. So -- and probably, if I were to guess, I think we will see improved costs from suppliers, yes, I think we will -- that is our expectation.
Zachary Kirkhorn: And we're already starting to see that, Elon, I think you had mentioned before that we anticipated a crash in the lithium prices and some of that has flowed through by way of lithium carbonate reductions into battery cost. And the same thing will happen with lithium hydroxide. The length of the supply chain matters also because what we're talking about is very far upstream. So by the time it makes sense that battery that ends up in car. It will be several months. But beyond just the commodity pricing, as Zach mentioned earlier, we're also very focused on other metrics that make production very efficient. So, for example, detention and demurrage air expedites. I think our air expedites are down 90%. Detention and demurrage is down 93% from the peaks. That can be hundreds of thousands of dollars per vehicle. So we're sort of attacking all vectors and becoming very efficient.
Colin Rusch: Okay. And then, my follow-up is really around stationary storage demand on the utility scale. I mean, obviously, there's a gigantic queue for interconnection in the US. And can you talk about the volume of quotation you're seeing at this point around stationary storage for the renewables queue on a global basis? And how much of that is converting into actual sales?
Elon Musk: Drew, do you want to take that?
Andrew Baglino: I mean -- yes, I don't -- that's also not exactly how we look at it, really. We're not like -- yes, we're not engaged in the interconnection queue. Like we're focused on ramping Megapack as quickly and efficiently as we can, and we have visibility into the pipelines of a variety of different renewable energy and just pure stationary storage developers and we also develop our own projects. And we're mostly just -- we're being selective in trying to pick the products, the projects that best fit our mission and our objectives.
Elon Musk : Yes. This -- again, this is not a product call, but we'll have something, I mean, this -- we're making improvements on many fronts, including Megapacks. So I think some of those improvements will improve the speed at which you can connect the Megapacks to the grid.
Martin Viecha : Thank you. The next question is from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney : Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. Do you still see 2 million units as an upside case for volume this year? And is the gating factor for reaching 1.8 million or 2 million units in 2023 still supply chain, as was mentioned on your last conference call, or is it more about demand at this point?
Elon Musk : Well, if you have a crystal ball you can lend me back to the crystal ball situation. These are volatile times. From a production standpoint, if things go well, we've got a shot at 2 million vehicles this year. But that's an upside case. And we feel comfortable with 1.8 million. And we'll have to see how this year unfolds.
Mark Delaney : That's helpful. Thanks. And then the company had spoken at the Investor Day and then for the past conference calls about opening up its vehicle charging network. Can you speak to some of the feedback you've been getting from both Tesla owners and non-Tesla owners? And how the ramp of the charging network may progress from here? Thanks.
Elon Musk : Drew, do you want to take that?
Andrew Baglino: Yes. So as you may have seen, we opened our first V4 post in Europe and our Magic Dock post in North America in Q1. I mean, that is indicative of the direction we're heading with universal compatibility for all vehicles no matter where the charge port is, et cetera, in all major markets, and we're going to continue to roll out those sort of improved offerings as we build new stations. We're always balancing like our ability to serve our own customers with our ability to serve new customers when doing that. I think we've been able to balance it rather well. For example, in Europe, 50% of all of our supercharging stations are open to all EVs, and we've been able to do that without any increase in wait times at all for anybody. So we're going to continue to take a similar approach as we do this in North America and China over the coming quarters.
Martin Viecha : Okay. Thank you very much. Let's go to Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.
Rod Lache : Hi, everybody. I just wanted to first just follow-up on your comments in your letter about leveraging your cost position as others struggle with unit economics and also taking into account the lifetime revenue, actually in a way that most other automakers will never see just given your service network and supercharging and other attributes. Can you just maybe give us a sense of how far you'd be willing to take this? Are there brackets around the range of initial margin that you'd be comfortable with? And again, any color that you might provide on the updated range of margins that you'd expect in the auto business?
Elon Musk : I think we may have answered this question or tried to ask this question a few times. But it's difficult to say what the margin will be. It depends on what the macroeconomic environment is like. So for example, if the Fed were to lower the rates, that would be super helpful for demand. If they raise them, that just raises the interest costs that buyers have to pay for to buy a car. So it reduces affordability and therefore, reduces demand. So it's -- but if -- like if we look past, say, this year or like go sometime next year, middle of next year, so I think things are looking really -- I think, like I said, albeit if there's some major geopolitical wildcard that turns up. But in the absence of that, I think I would be very optimistic about middle of next year, end of next year.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Just to add to Elon's comments, just two other points. What's really important for us this year in addition to just managing the day-to-day of the business but is also investing in, as Elon mentioned, what 2024 and 2025 will look like. And so using the cash generated from the sale of products today and reinvesting that, this is very important for us. And I think that what happens to margins over the next couple of quarters that only matters in the context of what that means for our ability to reinvest into 2024 and 2025. And we have a lot of space before that becomes something that we have to revisit our investment plans. And so we're planning to keep the business healthy. But I just want to caution folks about reading too much into what happens over the near-term here because we're very focused as a company on making sure that when we exit this macroeconomic situation, this company is positioned in the best possible way.
Elon Musk: Yes, exactly.
Rod Lache: Just to elaborate on that point though, the revenue, the long-term lifetime revenue that you're targeting from each vehicle is massive. So if you took that to the extreme, it would seem that you'd be comfortable with a relatively low initial margin. Am I misinterpreting that, or is that exactly right?
Elon Musk: Correct. That's exactly right.
Rod Lache: Okay. And the -- normally, in a recession, when consumers feel less financially secure, actually price elasticity deteriorates. Just based on your pulse taking of the consumer, do you have a view on elasticity of demand?
Elon Musk: Well, I can't emphasize enough the whole -- just fundamental question of affordability. For most people, their ability to buy a car is a function of can they make monthly payment or not. And so like I said, if interest rates are really high, like they are right now, then in some cases, people can't get a loan at all. So it's -- I think probably banks are pretty -- not leaning forward in providing loans, I expect, these days. So that's -- like there is -- there is quite a powerful story here when you -- going back to something as alluded to a moment ago -- I mentioned a moment ago that Tesla is in a uniquely strong strategic position. Because we're the only ones making cars that technically, we could sell for zero profit for now and then yield actually tremendous economics in the future through autonomy, no one else can do that. I'm not sure how many people will appreciate the profundity of what I've just said, but it is extremely significant.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.
Adam Jonas: Hi everybody. So, first, Elon, good luck with tomorrow's launch of Boca Chica. Break a leg.
Elon Musk: Thanks. You can't have too much luck in the rocket business, that's for sure.
Adam Jonas: Incredible. So, now that you've gotten another Twitter architecture kind of intimately well over the past six months, what can you tell Tesla stakeholders about how an X.com or Super App could be potentially accelerative to Tesla's business model?
Elon Musk: Well, I don't know. I guess it could make it potentially make it easier to buy cars. So, -- We've string somewhat off topic here because I think there's some benefit. I think probably there's some benefit, yes.
Adam Jonas: I get it, Elon,. So just as a follow-up on manufacturing, you're a student of history. And you'll note that back in 1913, Henry Ford introduced the moving assembly line in Highland Park, Michigan. And the price of a Model T, which had already been undercutting cars around the time, fell another 70% or 80%, and hundreds of rival car companies went bust. I'm wondering if history is repeating itself here, Elon, and that the recent pattern of cuts with you is way ahead of the cost curve compared to competition? Is this -- it seems like it's a calculated strategy, not just in reaction to competition or changing supply demand in the market, but your -- could we catalyze some Darwinian forces in the EV market?
Elon Musk: Well, I mean, we're not trying to say, take pricing actions in order to be deliberately -- to deliberately undermine competitors or anything like that. We really don't think about competitors that much. We just look at, do people like our cars, how can we make the product better, can they afford our cars? And the sort of the things like improving service and whatnot. But actually, we do have this unique strategic advantage that we have -- we're making a car that if autonomy pans out and we think it will, where that asset is actually will be worth a hell a lot more in the future than it is now. So, it is taking to be possible to sell it at zero profit, but still have the net present value of future cash flows associated with that asset very significant.
Andrew Baglino: And service and charging and insurance and all of these other ongoing revenue streams that other companies don't have.
Elon Musk: Yes.
Karn Budhiraj: Certainly, we want all EVs to succeed, too. We just want to say that we're not like some malicious attacks to try to destroy everybody.
Elon Musk: Definitely not. We're like opening up superchargers. We've made our patents available for free. So, it's like -- we're trying to be helpful here. So we're not out to destroy competitors or anything like that. We're trying to help competitors, frankly, in any way we can.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to Dan Levy from Barclays.
Dan Levy: Hi. Good evening. Thank you. First question, you're ramping supply at Austin and Berlin. So I wanted to understand just how critical it is to further increase volume at those plants just to get the vertical integration benefits in the face of the market with some demand questions. And just broadly, should we -- I mean, historically, you've been operating at the pace at which your supply allows you to produce as opposed to gauging to demand. Should we generally expect that you're going to continue to produce at your -- whatever the max capacity that you're allowed within your supply constraints, regardless of what the broader economic environment is just to continue to get that volume out there?
Elon Musk: So that is -- yes, I mean, there could be like obviously a macro shock that is so severe that people just stop buying cars for some reason. But in the absence of that, we will continue to grow output at a rapid clip.
Dan Levy: Great. Thank you. And then just on the margins associated with Austin and Berlin. You mentioned Austin want to have the margin drag until you reach intended volumes. I don't know if you can disclose what those volumes are. And then maybe you could just remind us of what the margin profile of Austin and Berlin will look like versus Shanghai once you get the vertical integration benefits in place?
Elon Musk: Well, probably one have be quite as good as Shanghai. Shanhai is hard to -- has a very efficient cost structures, obviously, our lowest cost structure in the world. But we do expect to be -- make significant improvements in Austin and Berlin and continue to make improvements in Fremont as well. So...
Roshan Thomas: For making improvements in North America & Berlin cost structures, we've increased -- this is Roshan by the way. We increased our localization efforts strategically. So that will then drive down our days on-hand requirements reducing tied up working capital. We've made 10% quarter-over-quarter improvement in days on-hand. So we'll continue that improve cost structure as supplier localization improves.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you very much. And our final question comes from Philippe Houchois from Jefferies.
Philippe Houchois: Yes, good evening, and thanks for taking the question. It's slightly longer term. I completely agree with your comments that we should look at Tesla in terms of auto market share and not EV market share. But I'm just wondering, as you build up the market share globally, is there a limit to the direct selling business model as you practice it? And should we think about -- going forward, you need to look into the agency or using importers to basically develop market share more smoothly, I guess, globally? And so in other words, is there kind of fell by date for the direct business model as you practice it today?
Zachary Kirkhorn: Seems to be working well so far because we hear different feedback from customers who miss the human interaction or unhappy with the service, and I'm just wondering if you're seeing some growth pains in there that would lead you to change. You're not seeing that?
Elon Musk: Well, I mean, there are -- since we're always going to have some growing pains where at times -- and it depends on which geography we're talking about where sometimes service is behind sales, sometimes it's ahead of sales. This is -- I mean, Telsa's growing, I believe, faster than any company in history that makes a large complex manufactured object. So these are – as you try to max – it's always difficult to match exponentials. So – but I think it is helpful to have the feedback loop with a service because that means we feel the pain of service, and then we can address the design to make the car need less service. And I think that gives us the right incentive structure, like because the best service is no service. The car doesn't break. And whereas if you have say a dealer network that is reliant upon services revenue, then you arguably have a misalignment of incentives where they're making money on service. But actually, we want to – the best thing for the consumer is the car doesn't need servicing so.
Philippe Houchois: Yeah. And then last one, if I can follow up. Have you worked out, I mean, for many of your traditional competitors, a fair amount of profits for them comes from selling spare parts and servicing, and you don't have that in your profit structure. And have you looked at the deficit you have compared to your peers?
Elon Musk: Yeah. Actually, this one -- assuming I could wax on about for a while because really, people didn't understand that the best short-selling argument against Tesla for the longest time was the fact that Tesla does not have an existing fleet and that the auto industry, the reason incumbents succeed and newcomers fail, the biggest reason is that the incumbents have a large fleet, and they're able to sell new cars at close to zero margin and then sell spare parts at a very high margin, sort of razors and blades type thing. And so the only way to actually succeed for a newcomer to succeed is to have a product that is so compelling that people are willing to pay a premium over the incumbent product. And in the absence of electrification and autonomy, I don't think a newcomer can succeed.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much, everyone. Unfortunately, that's all the time we have for this quarter. We'll see you again in three months from now. Thank you."
790,ON,1,2023,2023-05-01 11:43:05,"Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the ON Semi First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call.

Now let me turn it over to Hassane. Hassane?
Hassane El-Khoury: Thank you, Parag. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As we continue our transformation, I'm pleased to report another quarter where we've exceeded expectations with revenue of $1.96 billion and non-GAAP gross margin of 46.8%, both above the midpoint of our guidance. The current market environment did not deter us from our goals, we have teams around the world, who are committed to operational excellence and I am proud of the results they have achieved in this first quarter. Over the last two years, we centered our transformation around the structural changes that would enable us to better navigate the uncertainty in the semiconductor industry. We streamlined our product portfolio, reduced price to value discrepancies, double down on silicon carbide and improved the overall operations of the company. We have incredible talent in the company and we have been all hands on deck to solve some of the world's toughest engineering problems to accelerate the ramp of this next generation technology. Thanks to our team's relentless efforts we are seeing greater than anticipated silicon carbide results ahead of our internal plan for manufacturing output at every stage of the process from bulls to die to modules. In Q1 alone, these results allowed us to shift nearly double our Q4 revenue and more than half of our 2022 full-year revenue. We are on track to grow our revenue to $1 billion in 2023 and that's approximately 5 times the revenue of 2022 setting ourselves up for leadership in the silicon carbide market with the majority of the substrate sourced internally. Demand for electric vehicles, ADAS and energy infrastructure remained healthy amid a broad-based macroeconomic slowdown. While our automotive revenue increased 38% year-over-year, it was flat quarter-over-quarter. We are still supply constrained across several automotive technologies, while in some other technologies, we are cautiously monitoring inventory digestion. In Q2, we expect to see quarter-over-quarter growth in our automotive revenue. In Q1, we shifted our mix to energy infrastructure where there is high demand and high growth. Our industrial revenue in turn increased 1% sequentially instead of the decline we had anticipated. Driven by the need for alternative energy, sources and accelerated by global geopolitical issues, installation of energy storage systems is increasing along with our content that includes silicon carbide and silicon power solutions. Pricing across our business is stable and we don't anticipate any changes in the pricing environment. A significant part of our business is secured by long-term supply agreements and pricing in these agreements is fixed for multiple years. Also, as part of our business transformation, we have walked away from price sensitive businesses in non-strategic areas to drive predictable financial results. In Q1, automotive and industrial accounted for 79% of our total revenue, as compared to 65% in the quarter a year ago. When we started our transformation, we targeted 75% of our business to be automotive and industrial by 2025 and we have achieved our desired end result two years earlier. We also improved our demand visibility across all markets with commitments from our customers, new and existing in the form of LTSAs. These LTSAs also help reduce our exposure to the volatility in the consumer and computing markets. Volkswagen as an example, signed a three-year agreement for more than 100 current production devices giving them the required supply chain sustainability with a major semiconductor partner, our committed revenue through LTSAs increased again in Q1 by $1 billion. We are supporting our customers today while working closely with them on next generation designs for their intelligent power and sensing needs. In addition to the LTSA we announced last quarter, we were recently honored with the 2022 Supplier of the Year Award from Hyundai Motor Group, which recognized ON Semi as a trusted provider for key technology in its ecosystem, offering supply chain resilience and manufacturing sustainability. Customers also recognize us as a strategic partner that provides high value through the entire design cycle, which gives them a competitive edge over their peers. In March, we launched our new Elite Power Simulation tool to bring complex power electronics applications to market faster through system level simulations, saving design engineers from expensive time consuming hardware fabrication and testing in the early stages of development. This tool will also allow us to get a broader customer reach through our distribution network with a low touch model to design in our products. Global automotive OEMs are choosing to partner with On Semi for the superior performance of our end-to-end silicon carbide solutions. Just last week, we announced an LTSA with ZEEKR, a leading all EV manufacturer in China, who has selected On Semi's third generation 1,200 volt EliteSiC MOSFET to increase the electric powertrain efficiency and extend the range of its expanding portfolio of high performance electric vehicles. These EliteSiC power devices deliver improved power and thermal efficiency, which reduced the size and weight of the traction inverters to deliver improved performance resulting in extended driving range and faster charging speeds. BMW Group has also selected On Semi's EliteSiC to support range extension for their next generation electric vehicles. They secured an LTSA with us to equip their future electric drivetrains with our silicon carbide technology to increase efficiency and system level performance. We also continue to invest in silicon power and as auto OEMs move to Zonal Architecture, we deliver intelligent power solutions that meet all voltage range requirements from 12 volts to 48 volts and beyond. Through these strategic partnerships, we are enabling our customer sustainability efforts, while also working on our own. We committed to the science-based targets initiative and pledged to set near-term science-based emission reduction targets in line with SPTI criteria and our decarbonization journey to achieve net zero emissions by 2040. Our Q1 revenue for intelligent sensing increased 26% year-over-year. We introduced our new Hyperlux Family of image sensors to support the transition to eight megapixel devices where ASPs can be up to 2.5 times that of one or two megapixel image sensors. Our traction for image sensors in automotive has proliferated into industrial automation and smart retail applications. Our newest eight megapixel image sensor achieved stunning 4K video quality with optimized near infrared response necessary for industrial applications with harsh lighting conditions such as security and surveillance, body cameras, doorbell cameras and robotics. The shift out of lower value commodity applications coupled with capacity expansion in differentiated products and packages reduced the supply to demand gap and is driving margin expansion and revenue growth in our focused markets. Automotive and Industrial now account for more than 95% of our intelligent sensing business. Beyond image sensing, our intelligent sensing penetration is expanding with other sensing solutions in our portfolio. We shipped our 1 billionth inductive position sensor IC to Hela, one of the largest automotive supplier, who uses our technology and their drive by wire systems such as accelerator pedal fencing, steering and torque sensors, as well as actuators for pressure boost and turbos. We also lead the market in automotive ultrasonic sensors with more than 20 sensors in one of the latest EV models from a leading European OEMs. In Q1, our intelligent power and intelligent sensing revenue accounted for 69% of our total revenue, as compared to 64% in the quarter a year ago. As we get ready for the next chapters and with our journey, we are applying what we know. Operational excellence in controlling what we can and executing to our commitments. We have positioned ourselves to lead in our focused markets with superior technology to offer our customers and we have the agility to pivot and adapt to change as required by the business and market environment. And more importantly, we have the team to execute. Now, I will turn the call over to Thad to provide additional details on our financial and guidance. Thad?
Thad Trent: Thanks, Hassane. As Hassane highlighted, we exceeded expectations in the first quarter, which is a testament to our employees around the globe, who are committed to operational excellence. Our ability to focus, invest and execute has provided benefits across all areas of the business and allowed us to maintain our financial targets, while navigating the market uncertainty. We continue to identify and extract operational efficiencies in our business groups and corporate functions, while identifying gross margin expansion opportunities. I'll start by diving into our results for the first quarter. Total revenue was $1.96 billion dollars above the midpoint of our guidance driven by strength in silicon carbide and energy infrastructure. In Q1, our silicon carbide manufacturing output was ahead of our internal plans and we nearly doubled our Q4 revenue, increasing our confidence in our past to the $1 billion year. Our automotive business now accounts for 50% of total revenue and at $986 million in Q1 it was flat sequentially, offset by a recovery in industrial revenue. Industrial revenue grew by 1% quarter-over-quarter, surpassing our original projections. We anticipate another stellar year for our Energy Infrastructure business with projected 50% growth over 2022 at accretive gross margins. Revenue for the Power Solutions Group or PSG was $1 billion dollars, an increase of 3% year-over-year and we saw sequential gross margin expansion as our silicon carbide ramp exceeded expectations on both revenue and margins. Revenue for the Advanced Solutions Group or ASG was $593 million, a decrease of 14% year-over-year and revenue for the Intelligent Sensing Group or ISG was up an impressive 32% year-over-year at a record of $354 million. ISG's impressive turnaround continues as Q1 was also their 11th quarter of gross margin expansion with record gross margin exceeding 50%. As a corporation, our consolidated gross margin held up nicely. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter was 46.8% above the midpoint of our guidance, driven by higher than anticipated industrial revenue and improved manufacturing performance for silicon carbide output. We also exited an additional $47 million of revenue in the quarter at an average gross margin in the mid-40% range, bringing the total revenue to-date to $341 million of non-core business exits. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined by 160 basis points quarter-over-quarter as expected with the ramp up of silicon carbide and EFK headwinds and lower factory utilization of 71% as we continue to slow wafer starts. Q1 was our first quarter of operations since acquiring our 300 millimeter fab in East Fishkill. The current operating cost is much higher than we had anticipated. So the dilutive impact is greater than we previously expected. However, based on our current outlook, we are confident we can realign the cost structure of the fab and drive efficiencies to recover by early 2024. As demonstrated in Q1, we expect to maintain our gross margin trajectory for 2023. Our financial strategy remains unchanged as does our capital allocation strategy. In Q1, we returned more than 100% of our free cash flow to our shareholders with share repurchases of $104 million. This was the first repurchase from our new authorization, which allows us to repurchase up to $3 billion through 2025. Additionally, we issued $1.5 billion in convertible notes in Q1 with the proceeds used to repay our term loan. This was essentially leverage neutral and highly accretive as we swapped out a portion of our variable rate debt approaching 7% with a fixed rate convert with a coupon of 50 basis points. We also entered a call spread transaction increasing the effective strike price to $156.78 per share, providing significant dilution protection. Now let me give you some additional numbers for your models. GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $352.6 million, as compared to $314.1 million in the first quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $286 million, as compared to $302.8 million in the quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating expenses were below our guidance as we manage discretionary spending across the company given the uncertain macro environment. We also initiated structural changes to ASG to improve operational efficiency by reallocating resources to high growth R&D initiatives, while improving our product development and time to market on industry-leading proprietary products. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 28.8% and non-GAAP operating margin was 32.2%, a decrease of 190 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Our non-GAAP tax rate was 16.3%, GAAP earnings per diluted share for the first quarter was $1.03, as compared to $1.18 in the quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.19 above the high end of our guidance. Our GAAP diluted share count was 448.5 million shares and our non GAAP diluted share count was 439.1 million shares. Turning to the balance sheet, cash and cash equivalents was $2.7 billion and we had $1.6 billion undrawn on our revolver. Cash from operations was $408.9 million and free cash flow was $87.4 million or $4.4 of revenue. Free cash flow was negatively impacted by timing of annual bonuses and CapEx payments. Capital expenditures during Q1 were $321.5 million, which equates to a capital intensity of 16.4% for the quarter. As we indicated previously, we are directing a significant portion of our capital expenditures toward silicon carbide and enabling our 300 millimeter capabilities at East Fishkill fab and expect our capital intensity to be in the mid to high teen percentage range for the next several quarters. Accounts receivable of $880.9 million increased by $38.6 million and DSO of 41-days increased by four days. Inventory increased by $198.1 million sequentially and days of inventory increased by 23 days to 159 days. This includes approximately 43 days of bridge inventory to support fab transitions and the impending silicon carbide ramp. We continue to proactively manage distribution inventory, decreasing inventory in the channel by $79 million sequentially and at historically low levels with weeks of inventory at 7 weeks, compared to 7.3 weeks in Q4. Total debt was $3.5 billion and net leverage is $0.25. In Q1, we accrued $41 million in balance sheet under property, plant and equipment related to the 25% investment tax credit for investments in our U.S. Factories. This will eventually flow through our income statement as lower depreciation and will receive the associated cash benefit in the future. Let me now provide you key elements of our non-GAAP guidance for the second quarter. The table detailing our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance is provided in press release related to our first quarter results. Our business continues to strengthen with total committed revenue under LTSAs of $17.6 billion, an increase of $1 billion quarter-over-quarter. We expect to recognize approximately $5.8 billion of committed revenue from our LTSAs in the next 12 months in addition to our non-cancelable non-returnable orders. Given the macro uncertainty, we are taking a cautious stance in our guidance. We anticipate Q2 revenue will be in the range of $1.975 billion to $2.075 billion. We expect automotive and industrial to increase quarter-over-quarter with other markets flat to down as we plan further exits in our non-strategic end markets. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 45.5% and 47.5%, due to lower factory utilization, EFK headwinds and the dilutive impact of ramping silicon carbide, which remains ahead of plan. This also includes share-based compensation of $4.5 million. As we previously stated 2023 will be a transition year for our gross margins and we expect to maintain our trajectory as we manage these temporary headwinds. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $297 million to $312 million, including share-based compensation of $28.8 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP OIE will be $3 million to $5 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range 15.5% to 16.5% and our non-GAAP diluted share count for the second quarter is expected to be approximately 440 million shares. This results in non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $1.14 to $1.28. We expect capital expenditures of $420 million to $460 million, primarily in brownfield investments in silicon carbide and EFK, which are a more efficient use of capital than the greenfield alternative of building a fab from the ground up. We are very proud of our financial results through this transformation and will continue to deliver value for our shareholders. We are equally pleased with our cultural transformation. On Semi is a very different company today. We challenge the status quo and we hold ourselves accountable to our commitments. As many of you know, we'll be holding an Analyst Day in New York on May 16, and we look forward to sharing our future plans to accelerate value for our shareholders. We hope to see you there. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Kevin to open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore: Hi guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Hassane, I want to ask about the auto side of your business. Investors are getting a little more concerned just about the -- that market given that it's of the few that hasn't cyclically adjusted. And you guys were flat sequentially versus what you thought would be up a bit and that's all despite the silicon carbide side, upsiding. So I guess could you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing there, inventory, demand and perhaps separate the silicon carbide side from the other parts of the business when you give that answer, please?
Hassane El-Khoury: Sure. Look, obviously for silicon carbide, it's a ramping business for us. You've seen tremendous progress in the first quarter, slightly ahead of where we thought we would be based on just the team doing a stellar job ramping the technology, that's going to keep ramping throughout the year. You can think about it as an uptick in the second-half as we accelerate the -- exiting the year on track for the $1 billion that we talked about and every day, we had more and more confidence in those numbers. The rest of automotive, obviously, we have some technologies that remain constrained, so demand is healthy. We remain constrained in our ability to supply to that demand. You can think about that as our silicon high voltage, silicon medium voltage, that not just go to the EV demand, but also a broader aspect of that demand. Other technologies, we're monitoring the inventory digestion. As I said in my prepared remarks, that was, kind of, the first quarter where we wanted to look at it. We used that opportunity to drain the distribution inventory where you see we went from 7.3 weeks to 7 weeks and that's a pretty big number over $70 million of a $1 drained from the inventory, because we wanted to set ourselves up for the uncertainty in the second-half of the year that everybody keeps talking about. So from a demand, I'm comfortable with the EV, that's a ramping business for us. The rest we're cautiously monitoring. However, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Q2 is an up quarter for us in Q1. So you can think about automotive as we took a breather in Q1 to test the inventory and we're going to keep ramping for the rest of the year. Full-year, we're going to be up from last year, so that gives you kind of an idea on the overall demand as we see it outside of quarter-on-quarter fluctuation.
Ross Seymore: Perfect. Thanks for that. And I guess moving from my follow-up over to Thad on the gross margin side of things. It seems like there were quite a few moving parts, especially the East Fishkill in the silicon carbide side, but the net of it all seems be right in line with your plan. Can you just talk a little bit about those moving parts? East Fishkill is more expensive, but silicon carbide is ahead of plan. Does that still net out to the same trajectory through the rest of the year? Just walk us through those puts and takes and maybe the utilization side as part of that as well, please?
Thad Trent: Yes. So the utilization dropped in the quarter from about 74% to 71%. We expect, kind of, what we're seeing right now is utilization to stay in that range plus or minus for the remainder of the year. Obviously, if there's a second-half recovery, we can ramp up quickly. You nailed it on the rest of it silicon carbide performed better-than-expected, EFK cost as I said is coming in significantly higher than we expected. You can think about these as being, kind of, orders of magnitude more dilutive than what we expected. The good news is we are absorbing that. As I said, we're finding additional opportunities to improve gross margin across the company and we're able to absorb that. We believe by the time we get into 2024, we've got the cost structure of EFK back in line to where we would expect it to be. So we're really confident in the margin outlook for this year, I don't think anything changes. I think if we look at Street consensus for gross margin for 2023, even with these headwinds, we think we can execute to that -- those expectations.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Hassane, I wanted to ask about your plans for in-sourcing the material side for silicon carbide. Can you give us a progress on how that's going? I believe you said during the prepared remarks that you are targeting to be majority in-source? Is that a full-year comment? Is that an exiting Q4 comment? So just give us an update on where you are from an in-sourcing perspective? And let's say if you are majority in-sourced exiting the year, how does that help you on the gross margin side?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes, look, my comment is exiting the year. It's basically reiterating our plan that I've stated throughout the year -- last year of establishing the supply, establishing the growth in our Hudson facility in order to set ourselves up exiting the year majority. So that holds even more now given the progress that we've had in Hudson just in the last quarter, which drove a lot of our favorability in our results and the gross margin as Thad talked about. So I remain very, very happy with where we are from the progress and the confidence that we have in reiterating our plans. As far as the gross margin obviously in-sourced is always better, because you can see the merchant, there's always margin stacking that happens. So our ability to be able to mix and have a majority exiting, of course, helps the margin as we move through the year. But the biggest portion of the margin expansion for silicon carbide is really going to come from the utilization of that fixed cost that we've implemented. And that remains on track for us to get that business to at or above the corporate margin. So we remain very focused on that and really satisfied with where we've done so far.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And for my follow-up, Hassane, I think you mentioned that, so specific to autos, that you took the opportunities in Q1 to drain some of the inventory. How are you seeing the overall pricing environment as you look Q2 through Q4 versus what you thought earlier, are there any changes? There's a lot of macro across currents, but how is that impacting your automotive outlook, Q2 through Q4, especially on the pricing side? Are there any changes one way or another?
Hassane El-Khoury: Absolutely no changes, it’s actually very predictable and that's really the benefit that we've been talking about with the LTSAs that have us really with our customers align on pricing and volume through the duration of the LTSAs. So no conversations about pricing. The focus has always remained on supply and that's holding up not just through the year, but through the extent of the LTSAs we have with the customers. So very, very stable and no pressure on that. And by the way, it's not just an automotive. The pricing is holding up across all markets where we have LTSAs and we -- because we -- as you know, we've been focusing on products that provide value. It's not a pricing conversation, it’s about what the products bring to the customer. The things that would have pricing pressures, in Thad, talked about how we have been focusing on exiting that business, to the point where it's above the business we exited had a four handle on the gross margin and we still are steadfast on exiting, because that is where the margin pressure will come in and the pricing pressure and we're not going to play in these markets and we're getting ahead of it and exiting those businesses.
Vivek Arya: Excellent. Thank you, Hassane.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi. Your line is open.
Chris Danely: Thanks, guys. I didn't know I went from a Jewish to Italian overnight. Anyway, can you just give us a little update and some color on the shortages and the lead time situation? I guess for Hassane, our shortage is pretty much exclusively in the automotive business or are they elsewhere? And then there any point in time this year where you think the shortages will go away?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes, look, so the -- for me, I always refer to shortages as technologies, because they're across all markets where we provide them. High voltage silicon is of course constrained technology for us. We ramped capacity, yet the demand is much higher than even our increased capacity. And for that business, for example, it goes into automotive and it goes into industrial specifically in our alternative energy. And as Thad said, that's ramping very nicely this year after a very stellar ‘22 ramp that we talked about last year. So that is technology that is constrained. We have some intelligent power technologies that are constrained. Think about it as mixed signal analog where demand in automotive and demand in industrial both have been increasing ahead of the capacity we've added. So those are technologies agnostic of markets. We remain constrained, not because of just capacity, but demand keeps accelerating, because of the markets we are participating in. As far as the second-half of the year, that really depends on what your view is for the second-half of the year. Based on our outlook, that technology will still remain constrained there, while in other areas, not in these specific technologies, we're seeing some flattening in our lead times and therefore we can see some of that easing. But the second-half is really going to depend on what the demand does. And based on our outlook, we're going to remain constrained.
Thad Trent: Yes. And on the lead time. Lead times are relatively stable running, kind of, in that 41 to 43 week timeframe. Quarter-on-quarter, I think down a week to two weeks, but I would call it pretty much across the board lead times are stable.
Chris Danely: Okay. Great. And then for my follow-up, just I guess one for Thad. So as the CapEx is ramping Thad, can you just talk about maybe over the next three to five years, how that's going to impact depreciation and gross margin and can this all be offset by the efficiencies or what will be the, I guess, the gross margin headwind from all those CapEx a little farther down the road?
Thad Trent: Yes, well. I would start out by saying we're making big investments in silicon carbide and EFK as I've mentioned. Now as you think about our capital expansion and expansion in just capacity is to support the LTSAs that we have, right? So this is not a situation where we're building capacity hoping that we can fill it. So we're very comfortable that with our margin projections that we can absorb that additional depreciation. I would tell you in general, I wouldn't call it significant, but what you would see is offsetting revenue and gross margin to offset that depreciation.
Chris Danely: Perfect. Thanks guys.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Hi, good morning. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had a follow-up question on gross margins as well, Thad. Just curious on how we should be thinking about the timing of headwinds from both the silicon carbide ramp and the EFK ramp peaking? Is that sort of a second-half ‘23 dynamic or should we expect the headwinds to stay relatively elevated in the early part of ‘24? And also the benefits from your fab light strategy, I think you've sized it at $160 million and reduce costs over time once we expect those benefits to kick in?
Thad Trent: Yes. So the impact of the $160 million, I'll start there. We expect to get that as we exit those fabs. We think that really starts to kick in in ‘24 and ‘25 it takes at least three years to exit a fab. So I think most of that starts to roll in ‘24 and ‘25. On the headwinds from silicon carbide and EFK, so the EFK has already hit us in Q1. You can think about that as being pretty consistent through the year. We think by early 2024, we can get that back in line and it isn't the headwind that we that we got surprised with. On silicon carbide, it's ahead of schedule, which is really great. It’s performing much better than we expected. There is a headwind there, we think it likely peaks, kind of, in that Q3 timeframe. And then we think by the time we get to ‘24, it’s -- those margins are at the corporate average, so that's behind us as well. EFK will be a little bit of a drag as we've talked about previously in ‘24 and ’25, as we continue to do that foundry business for global foundries, but we think we can get the cost structure back in line this year.
Toshiya Hari: That's helpful. Thank you. And then as my follow-up, one for Hassane, a little longer term. I think at your previous Analyst Day, you had guided revenue growth for the overall company in kind of the 7% to 9% range. I think that was a 2025 model, I think you have pretty good visibility given the LTSA pipeline, is the 7% to 9% range still the right range in your view as you think about the overall company over the several years? Or do you think with silicon carbide and some of the other opportunities that you've secured, you could potentially outgrow that? Thank you.
Hassane El-Khoury: Well, I would say, must be present to win. I'll see you in -- at our Analyst Day on May 16 for that one.
Toshiya Hari: Okay, I tried. Thank you.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper. Your line is open.
Harsh Kumar: Yes. Hey, guys. First of all, congratulations on a very successful transition so far, Hassane, Thad and team and then also the near-term results in a choppy environment. So first question I had is we had a peer of yours in another perhaps segment in the auto business that had poor results out of China or at least they blame China, EV slowdown. I was curious, given your position in China, if you could comment on what you're seeing in the EV market, and then I've got a follow-up.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes, look, I mean, we all see the EV market in China. But the difference for us is China for us is a ramping market. And that's really going to be contributing to our ramp throughout the year. So even if the demand call it on the top demand is a little choppy, out of China. For us, it's incrementally favorable and we're going to continue to ramp there, so we don't see it. We're kind of disconnected from it given that for us, it's a ramp. It's not a mature market yet, and that puts us in a very good position.
Harsh Kumar: Thanks, Hassane. And then maybe one for Thad. What is -- you talked about the timing for the silicon carbide headwind and the Fishkill scale headwind. Could you quantify what you're seeing in terms of headwind? Would you be able to give us a number? And then the second part of that question is I think Hassane, you mentioned in your comments that or maybe Thad did that by the third quarter timeframe, your silicon carbide business would be a corporate margin. So are we thinking 40s, high-40s or we thinking 50s ultimately as a stable gross margin to the silicon carbide business?
Thad Trent: Yes. So harsh, what we said is at scale, at once we fully ramped so it can carbide, those margins would be at or above the corporate average. As I said, we've got headwinds that we think peak in Q3. We think by the time we get to ‘24, that headwind is behind us. In terms of the magnitude of the headwind, we've said historically that the silicon carbide is 100 basis points to 200 basis points of a headwind. We're performing better than we expected. So you can think about that as not at the high end of that range, it’s somewhere in between there. But we're very confident in our outlook here based on our performance that, that we can continue to execute there and we feel very good. On EFK, as I said, we had the full impact in Q1. You can see we absorbed it and offset it with gross margin expansion in other areas. Historically, we've said that’s 40 basis points to 70 basis points, I've said it's significantly higher. You can think about it as being greater than 2 times, what our expectations were. Again, we think we can absorb that throughout the year. Our margin trajectory doesn't change and we're very comfortable with Street consensus on gross margin for the year. So I think it gives you -- our confidence in managing through this.
Harsh Kumar: Thanks, fellas.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Next question comes from Raji Gill with Needham. Your line is open.
Raji Gill: Yes, thank you and congratulations as well on great results in a tough environment. Just a quick question on the automotive market, you mentioned Hassane, a modest inventory digestion in the end market and then you're also kind of reducing distribution inventory. Can you talk a little bit about the overall demand picture for automotive. I know it's hard to kind of separate the significant ramp that you're seeing in electric vehicles and in turn silicon carbide. But just curious if there's a softness in the demand market, if there's a shift away from high-end to mid-range, any kind of color on the automotive market will be appreciated?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes, look. We don't see a big disconnect into demand. It was like I said, it was a momentary thing where we use this opportunity to kind of reposition the inventory that we have externally and we'll get back to growth in the second quarter and through the year giving us an increase in our automotive revenue year-over-year. So that really doesn't change the outlook. But what we take a look at, if you think about it, it's a stable environment we're going to be growing in automotive. If I really don't see any areas that causes us pause or a change in our outlook. So we remain confident with that.
Raji Gill: All right. Very good. And from my follow-up on the LTSAs, you talked, Thad about $17.6 billion that was up $1 billion quarter-over-quarter. Was that all primarily related to silicon carbide incremental designs or other drivers? And just along those lines, you saw kind of significant growth in energy infrastructure, you're talking about it up 50% year-over-year. Can you describe what are some of the tailwinds in that market? Thank you.
Thad Trent: Yes. So the LTSAs, we continue to stack those up another $1 billion this quarter to $17.6 billion, it's broad, it’s across the board. There's silicon carbide, there's non-silicon carbide. But when we think about how we're engaging with our customers that want assurance of supply, they're looking at the entire portfolio and locking that up with us for multiple years. And again, keep in mind these LPSAs on average are four to five years. So it's -- as Hassane said, pricing is stable and those really gives us better predictability of our business and we're happy that we continue to engage with customers on that way. We see customers expanding their LTSAs either by adding additional part numbers or extending the duration and then we've got new customers that have been on the outside looking in. That are coming in saying we need to get an LTSA with you. And so we think that trend will continue.
Hassane El-Khoury: And then on the alternative energy, the tailwind is going to be market-driven. We had a stellar year in ‘22 from ’21, and that's compounding now what we're going to see in ‘23 from ‘22 and that's all of it is market-driven, and that's primarily the big components here are silicon power and silicon carbide. But again, as Thad mentioned, we have a penetration with the whole bomb, bill of material. And if you recall most of that market for us is under LTSAs, we have LTSAs with eight of the top 10 energy vendors in the world and they're ramping given the demand and we're ramping with them given our content.
Raji Gill: Thank you very much.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen. Your line is open.
Matt Ramsay: Thank you very much guys. Good morning. Hassane, I wanted to -- there's so much focus that typically goes into the silicon carbide space on substrate. But you guys mentioned a few times ramping CapEx and other things around Brownsfield fabs in order to support the business as you ramp the substrates that are GTAT. Maybe you could give us a little bit of color on how the non-substrates part of your supply chain is going for silicon carbide? And just what position that might give you guys on a cost basis relative to some others that are doing Greenfield facilities? Thanks.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. So look, as I mentioned, we're -- we've been increasing capacity. We started in 2022 in preparation for the ‘23 ramp and really the ‘24 ramp in this case where a lot of the focus, like you said, has been on substrate, because that's the first thing we have to ramp. But with increased capacity in our wafering and internal EPI, that gives us a very big cost advantage versus getting turnkey externally. And then following that is increase in our fab capacity, which also gives us a much better cost structure. Because the fab we are ramping is an existing power fab that's where we do really most of our IGBTs. And having a power fab at scale, gives us that edge one from a cost and two from the speed at which we can scale. So think about it this way, increasing capacity in an existing fab that already does power is way cheaper and way less risk than Brownfield and a power fab and silicon carbide. That has always given us the confidence in our ramp, has always given us the confidence in the slope of the ramp, which really exceeds everyone else out there and we're on track to achieving it, all of these give us one the cost, two the risk mitigation and three the confidence in our outlook.
Matt Ramsay: Thanks, Hassane. As my follow-up, I wanted to ask, I think both of you guys mentioned in your script this morning, some little pockets where you're -- I think the words were cautiously monitoring inventory. Maybe you could obviously, the growth of the company and the results speak for themselves and you're overcoming some of those things. But if you could just give us a little bit of color on where you are seeing those pockets of inventory? Are they clearing up? Are they getting worse? Just any color there would be helpful. Thanks guys.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes, look, when I say pockets again, I'll go back to my comment from prior about the technology. We remain constrained in technologies across all markets and there are areas primarily. You can think about it mostly on the consumer and compute where we've been -- one is cautiously monitoring specifically the disit inventory and that's why you've seen us even this quarter be very aggressive in draining the dollars in the channel. So although the weeks were 0.3 weeks down in the channel, but dollars are almost $80 million down. And that's a pretty steep decrease that we have been managing. And look, we've been managing it throughout the whole even the -- when supply was constrained across the board. So inventory for us is a big focal point not just internally, but externally. And until we get higher and higher confidence in what the second-half is going to bring, we're going to be cautiously optimistic and really holding back on what we ship out of the company unless we are seeing high confidence in its POS-ing. We're not going to have inventory just sitting around whether it's our distribution shelf or the customer shelf. And that really sets us up for a very nice recovery whenever that starts turning out to be.
Matt Ramsay: Thanks, Hassane.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Christopher Rolland: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. I'm going to talk about image sensors. You did talk about supply constraints across several auto tech. I just wanted to check the update of that. And then it seems like some of the drivers there or the move to 8 megapixel was wondering, kind of, what your competitive position is there, what percent of revenue might be at 8% versus 1% or 2% overall? Thanks so much.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes, look, obviously our competitive advantage across the board and image sensor is really on technology. We've talked about specific technology, I mentioned a few of them where it's the near infrared that helps with different lighting conditions, that of course applies in automotive and the examples I've given in my prepared remarks or start industrial, but it also applies in automotive where the high dynamic range whether it's very bright/light with sun or very dark at night. Those are all competitive advantage on the inherent in our technology that customers value and that we provide these solutions for. On the 8 megapixel, that's a new generation that we have launched across both auto and industrial. You're going to -- you can expect that to be forward-looking a mix shift as we ramp that. So today is very small. But the commentary I gave about ASP with of course also translates to improved margins that is on a forward-looking basis. Both Thad and I have always said our new products are at or ahead of our model, the 48% to 50% and as we ramp these products, you're going to see the margin expansion that will be contributed to by these products becoming a higher percent of revenue. So that's more of a forward-looking statement that again gives us the confidence in our margin trajectory and the fact that we've always said, it’s not -- the model is not the destination, it’s really a milestone.
Christopher Rolland: Excellent. And just maybe following up there and then a quick one. So you mentioned the supply constraints across several auto tech technologies. I think you mentioned some, but just wanted, kind of, that more comprehensive list. And then lastly, M&A you have a ton on your plate organically, but are you still considering inorganic and how do you see that market?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes, look, so across the board, obviously, I think I'll comment on image sensors, image sensors is a foundry business for us. We're seeing some easing in the foundry, so we get a little bit more capacity allocated to us. And I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we used this opportunity to really bridge that supply to demand gap that we've had in the last couple of years and we're making progress into catching up. We're not caught up yet, but we're making progress, so that remains constrained obviously. On high power silicon, think about it as IGBT or silicon carbide really. We've always said we're sold out on silicon carbide, so improvements that we have contribute to our achieving our numbers. IGBT, as I mentioned, remains constrained, because of strength and not just automotive market, but also in the industrial. A lot of our energy storage systems are silicon and silicon carbide, but a lot of it remains still today on silicon. So that adds some of that constraint, so you can see it's really across the board not specifically on markets, but it's driven by megatrend growth that we are participating in. As far as M&A, look, you're right, our focus is on execution. We have a lot going on, a lot of it is great work that creates a ton of value for our shareholders. So execution is key and execution is our focal point. But we never look away from M&A, we're always looking, because those are opportunities that we will participate in. But as we sit here today, I can't tell you there is something we are missing in order to achieve our organic plans of value creation. So we'll be opportunistic, we'll always drive and participate in the M&A landscape, but there's nothing I would say we have to have, which is the best place to be, because we can be very disciplined in our approach of M&A.
Christopher Rolland: Great update. Thanks, Hassane.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Gary Mobley: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and sneaking me in here. I know Harsh asked about the China EV market, but I wanted to ask more broadly about China indigenous demand. Where do you see that demand profile set today and maybe give us a sense of China did just demand as a percentage of your sale currently versus and where it's been in the past in terms of thinking about the optionality upside there?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes, look, in our -- just for China specifically in our non-strategic markets. Obviously, that's been down, both the market is down, but also that's not a strategic market for us, so we've been exiting and a lot of the exit is driven by the market in China for us. So that contributes, it's part of our plan, so that's not a surprise for us. It's actually what we anticipated and that's why we've been focusing on these exits, as far as protecting our margin and that's been our strategic plan all along. And we're starting to see it play out, which is not a surprise for us. On the EV, although there's some pause in EV or a little bit of redirection on the EV market in China for us, that market is actually net incremental. We are the ramping party in EV in China and therefore that will remain through the rest of the year even with the current outlook as a net favorable to our revenue growth. So we're -- I would say, no surprises, no changes to our outlook and no changes to our execution as we move forward this year.
Gary Mobley: Got it. As my follow-up, I want to ask about the supply of silicon carbide materials to support your $1 billion of revenue. I appreciate the fact that you'll be majority internally sourced for substrates exiting the year, but I presume that you'll probably purchase somewhere close to $200 million in merchant supply this year. Maybe if you can give us an update in terms of some of the constraints that you might be seeing there from your more traditional suppliers and how you may be broadening your supplier list there?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. Look, I'm not worried about the merchant supply. Obviously, our percent of internal is going to be incrementally going up throughout the year. We're going to be majority internal. But as far as derisking, we've done a very good job on having multiple sources that we are able to pull on. All sources, not internal, are qualified. And we're getting what we need. So therefore, think about it as a very good and already in the playbook risk mitigation strategy while we continue to execute greatly on our internal substrate.
Thad Trent: Yes. And I would just add that although it's a tight market out there, obviously, I think that's well known. We -- as I've said, we've been building inventory in silicon carbide for this ramp. So we've been preparing for it. And then obviously, as we get more flex into internally supplied substrates, that helps us.
Gary Mobley: Thanks, again.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
William Stein: Great. Thank you. Hassane, at the silicon carbide event you hosted, I think it was perhaps about a year ago. You talked about the trend in supply and demand in silicon carbide likely remaining in the shortage situation for many years. Then we have this surprise -- certainly surprised to many people announcement from Tesla that on their next-gen vehicle, the so-called Robotaxi, they're going to be reducing silicon carbide usage meaningfully. I know it's only one customer. I know they're still small share of global auto production, but it's an important customer. It's an important data point. I wonder how that influences your view of supply and demand for silicon carbide longer term, not just the next year, but as we think about five years plus?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. Look, actually, the announcement doesn't change my outlook. It actually -- I would say, confirms it because if you think about it, this is a new platform and a much broader platform as far as volume. And therefore, it's incrementally beneficial as far as demand is in the market, that's just on silicon carbide. The other thing is when you start thinking, and I don't want to talk about customers specifically. But as more and more, you can start thinking about silicon and silicon carbide, so IGBT plus SiC. This is a business that I've been talking about for really a couple of years. And you've heard me talk about how it's always a customer choice and our ability to supply both is incrementally beneficial for us. Therefore, when you start seeing silicon carbide, even with lower penetration of silicon carbide on a platform is still a net incremental silicon carbide in mass market vehicles. And that actually supports the concept that I've talked about that we are going to be constrained over the next few years.
William Stein: That's super helpful. One other, if I can? Perhaps, Thad, you talked about the product revenue and margin of the exits you did during the quarter. Can you remind us how much is left of that? What sort of duration you expect for the exits to last? And should we continue to expect sort of this mid-40s gross margin level on the exits going forward? Thank you.
Thad Trent: Yes. So we think for the year, there's a total of about $400 million of exits. This first quarter, we are at $47 million below our original expectations. We thought it was going to be higher than that this quarter. But we actually think we will still exit this throughout the year. I think this next quarter in Q2, we're probably looking at about $85 million of exits and then the remainder of that to be in the second-half. So you'll see these exits ramp additionally in the second-half. And the gross margin is -- yes, it's kind of in that mid-40% range of what we're going to lose currently. And this is the stuff that's price sensitive that -- the reason we're going to lose it is because we're not going to go down that pricing curve, right? So this is -- these exits over time, we think these gross margins go back into the in the low range that we're not willing to participate in. So yes, so for the year, about $400 million, and you can think about it as kind of the mid-40% gross margin range.
William Stein: Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to Hassane El-Khoury, President and CEO, for any closing remarks.
Hassane El-Khoury: Thank you again for joining our call. As Thad mentioned, we look forward to seeing many of you at our Analyst Day. Our future is bright, and we look forward to sharing with all of you what's next for On Semi. Thank you.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect. And have a wonderful day."
805,RIVN,1,2023,2023-05-09 20:53:09,"Operator: Good day, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Rivian’s First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today’s conference is being recorded. I will now hand the conference over to your speaker host, Tim Bei, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Tim Bei: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Rivian’s first quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we begin matters discussed on this call, including comments and responses to questions reflect management’s views as of today. We will also be making statements related to our business, operations and financial performance that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our SEC filings and today’s shareholder letter. During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures has provided in our shareholder letter. Just before the call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of our progress over the recent months. I encourage you to read it for additional details around some of the items we’ll cover on today’s call. With that, I’ll turn the call over to RJ who will begin with a few opening remarks.
RJ Scaringe: Thanks, Tim. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. I would like to highlight key developments during the first quarter as well as discuss progress on our key value drivers. We had a strong start to the year as our team delivered on our targets, including continuing to ramp R1 production, integration of the Enduro motor and LFP battery packs and improved operating efficiency. This quarter, I’ve asked Frank Klein, our Chief Operations Officer; and Nick Kalayjian, our Chief Product Development Officer, to join us for Q&A, given the importance of the launch and ramp of our Enduro motor platform. Last week, our R1S was awarded the highest possible safety rating of TOP SAFETY PICK+ from IIHS, joining our R1T which earned the award earlier this year. This makes the R1S the only large SUV and the R1T the only electric pickup to achieve this rating in 2023. During the first quarter, we produced 9,395 vehicles, which reflects continued quarter-over-quarter growth in R1 production. As of March 31, we’ve now produced nearly 35,000 vehicles since the start of production. Our team drove further improvement in the ramp of our consumer platform while successfully launching new technologies into our commercial ramp platform. Production during the first quarter was in line with our expectations, and as a result, we are reaffirming our production outlook for the year of 50,000 total units. In addition to production, we made significant progress on our technology and product development road maps during the first quarter. As described during our last earnings call, we took the EDV line down for most of the first quarter to implement our in-house and our drive units as well as LFP battery packs. Our Enduro production line is our first use our internally developed plant software platform designed to aid in the rapid bring up of equipment and our robotics. This platform offers greater control over our equipment and visibility into thousands of data points across all parts of the manufacturing process. Enduro’s providing cost improvements that will result in a significant reduction in our bill of materials. We expect to start implementing the Enduro motor into our R1 vehicles as a dual motor configuration during the second quarter of 2023, which will contribute to expanding our addressable market by enabling lower-priced future R1 variants. As a reference, the introduction of the Enduro and LFP battery pack in EDV enabled us to reduce the EDV bill of materials by approximately 25%. Our core priorities for 2023 are unchanged. The team remains focused on ramping production for our R1 and RCV platforms, driving cost reductions, developing the R2 platform and future technologies and delivering an outstanding end-to-end customer experience. Growing production volume improves fixed cost leverage at our large-scale manufacturing plant in Normal, Illinois. This is crucial to realizing the long-term structural cost advantages of our vertically integrated strategy and represents the primary lever on our path to sell each vehicle profitably. While challenges remain, we’ve become a stronger, more agile company through this process. The duration and magnitude of our impact is directly linked to our ability to produce vehicles profitably. We have a strong sense of urgency in achieving this goal, driving lower costs will be enabled by integration of new technologies such as Enduro and LFP battery packs as well as our company-wide program designed to maximize efficiency across key cost elements of material costs, logistics, labored overhead, indirect costs and capital expenditures. Beyond our push to drive operational efficiency, innovation that’s deliver both improved performance and range as well as simplified production, our core focus of our development teams. Much of the work we are doing in R1, including Enduro drive units simplified network architecture and updated sensor set and compute directly translates to our R2 platform. We are utilizing R1 to help capture and drive earnings to ensure a smooth ramp of R2. This alignment of technical road maps between R1 and R2 will help further drive long-term cost efficiencies. Finally, we continue to progress the purchase process and service experience. This year, we expect to grow our physical go-to-market infrastructure, including our mobile and physical service footprint, charging through our Rivian Adventure Network and Rivian spaces. Further, we plan to increase engagement with our preorder customers and drive additional demand by expanding our demo drive program, offering more opportunities for potential customers to experience Rivian vehicle. Overall, the progress we’re making against our core value drivers of ramping production, driving costs down, developing new technologies and platforms and enhancing customer experience positions us well to continue executing on our goals for the remainder of the year as well as into 2024. With that, I’ll pass the call over to Claire for more details on our financial and operating performance for Q1.
Claire McDonough: Thanks, RJ. The team’s achievements during Q1 established an important base of new technologies that will benefit Rivian for quarters to come through greater material cost reduction, enhanced range efficiency and access to additional market segments. Technologies such as Enduro and LFP are critical to achieve our long-term target cost structure across current vehicle platforms as well as R2. Turning to our first quarter results. We produced 9,395 vehicles and delivered 7,946 vehicles, which was the primary driver of the $661 million of revenue we generated. During 2022, we took measures to drive greater efficiency, which remains our focus for 2023. Compared to our fourth quarter of 2022, Q1 gross profit per delivered vehicle improved 46%. Cash SG&A expenses were relative flat, while cash R&D increased slightly, primarily due to restructuring expenses. Total gross profit for the quarter was negative $535 million, which was impacted by a net charge for LCNRV write-downs on inventory and losses on firm purchase commitments. The cumulative inventory write-downs and losses on firm purchase commitments of $822 million is comprised of $561 million of write-downs related to inventory on hand and $261 million of losses on firm purchase commitments. Given we are now in a new fiscal year, the LCNRV charge of $229 million, you will see on our statement of cash flows is reflected of the charge on new inventory purchased and firm purchase commitments entered into in Q1. The cumulative LCNRV and firm purchase commitments of $822 million represents a $98 million decrease versus the prior quarter due primarily to significant reductions in material costs for the EDV and an increase in average selling price for our R1 vehicles. As the cumulative LCNRV inventory write-down decreases, we expect to see an increase in net inventory balances and over time, a net decrease in cost of goods sold per vehicle. We forecast reaching positive gross profit in 2024 and therefore, expects by the end of 2024, we will no longer have material LCNRV inventory charges and losses on firm purchase commitments associated with our production at our Normal plant. Total operating expenses in the first quarter of 2023 fell to $898 million, as compared to $1.1 billion in the same period last year. The primary driver of the reduction in operating expenses was related to decreases in stock-based compensation. We continue to prioritize investments in our core and vehicle technologies and customer experience while also driving additional focus and cost optimization across the business. Adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter of 2023 was negative $1.1 billion as compared to negative $1.1 billion for the same period last year. Capital expenditures were $283 million in Q1 of 2023 as compared to $418 million during the same period last year. We ended the first quarter of 2023 with $11.8 billion in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. Importantly, during the quarter, we took steps to reinforce our robust liquidity position. Maintaining a strong balance sheet is a key priority. It provides a buffer during volatile industry conditions and mitigates risk while scaling significant growth capital projects. It also allows us to focus on delivering against our long-term growth plans, including the path to positive gross profit in 2024 as well as the launch of our R2. During the first quarter of 2023, we issued green convertible senior notes due in 2029, which generated proceeds of approximately $1.5 billion. In mid-April, we announced an amendment to our asset-based revolving credit facility, which doubles the available revolving commitments to $1.5 billion extends the maturity to 2028, improved borrowing availability by more efficient lending on some current assets and increases our permitted indebtedness provisions to expand debt capacity. In aggregate, these transactions have increased Rivian’s liquidity profile by over $2.4 billion, provide debt maturity beyond the launch of R2 and are reflective of our diversified approach to funding the business. We remain confident that our cash can fund operations through 2025 and believe with these recent additions, we have strengthened our balance sheet as we approach the launch of R2 in 2026. I also want to take this opportunity to reiterate our gross profit bridge from Q1 2023 to Q4 2024. We continue to target positive gross profit in 2024. Excluding the impact of LCNRV and firm purchase commitments, we expect approximately half of the improvement will be driven by greater volume and utilization of our installed capacity. Our 2023 production guidance of 50,000 units implies a doubling of capacity utilization, which will result in significantly lower fixed cost per vehicle, and we expect production volumes to increase further in 2024. The remaining half is split between increases in average selling prices and material cost reduction. Lower material costs will be enabled by the integration of new technologies such as Enduro and LFP battery packs, which delivered about a 25% material cost reduction for our commercial vehicles in Q1 versus Q4. In addition to the engineering design-driven cost reductions we also expect to realize commercial cost savings as we negotiate with our suppliers. The increase in average selling prices is based upon the gradual improvements we expect to achieve as we complete the fulfillment of our pre-March 2022 preorder base as well as the introduction of new technologies that produced improved performance and capabilities. While gross margin is expected to remain negative in 2023, Q1 represented significant progress versus Q4 2022 with gross profit loss per delivered vehicle nearly cut in half. This was due to cost of goods sold improvements and higher average selling prices. During the first quarter of 2023, cost of goods sold benefited from lower LCNRV, freight and material costs versus Q4 2022. While performance for any particular quarter may vary, we expect these trends to persist throughout 2023. We are reaffirming all aspects of our 2023 guidance. Most notably, we are reaffirming 2023 total vehicle production of 50,000 units and 2023 EBITDA guidance of negative $4.3 billion, which represents an improvement of $900 million versus 2022. Additionally, we expect capital expenditures for 2023 will be $2 billion. In closing, I want to reiterate our confidence in our long-term financial targets. We see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high teens EBITDA margin target and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target. With that, let me turn the call back over to the operator to open the line up for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Now first question coming from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open.
John Murphy: Good afternoon guys. Just wanted to ask a first question on pricing. I mean, RJ, sort of your entire strategy, you’ve kind of looked at the lifetime revenue opportunity of the vehicle and really thought about that in a holistic way. And I think I have a pretty good view of that. There are some folks that are taking that view and saying, ""Hey, listen, I can cut my upfront price on the vehicle and not make that much money on it and make up the profitability on the back end from that lifetime revenue and profit opportunity. I’m just curious, as you think about the company and the strategy and the philosophy of running it if you would ever think of embracing something like that, and then maybe as a sort of a second part of that question, you’re talking about raising pricing. So you’re kind of going in the opposite direction. How should we think about the cadence of the roll-off of the pre-March 2022 preorders that had the price protection?
RJ Scaringe: Thanks, John. It’s – these are, I think, really relevant questions here for us as we think about the pricing of vehicles. In the case of R1, this is our flagship product. So from a flagship product point of view, we’ve introduced with what we call a large pack and with our quad motor. And over the course over the next several months, we’re going to be launching our Max pack, which introduces a higher price variances R1, and it will also be introducing our Enduro motor with Enduro drive unit, which introduces our entry configuration. And so we’re both going to be growing pricing on some variants, but also offering some of our lower price variants at the same time. And for us, really important with that is giving customers and we see this for the data, giving customers what they’re looking for. And a significant portion of our customers are looking for the best of the best when it comes to R1 platform in terms of wanting to get the maximum range and maximum performance. And so we are really looking forward to getting the Max pack out there, and that will contribute to growing ASP. But as you said, the other element is the growth in post-March 1 orders or as Claire noted, the pre-March first orders have a lower price and as we start to come off of those orders and into newer orders, that’s going to naturally start to shift pricing up, we’re already seeing that in Q1 of this year. So those two together give us a lot of confidence in ASP growing over time for the R1 platform. Now more broadly as we think about the business in terms of revenue opportunities beyond the initial sale. This is something we also believe strongly and it’s driving a lot of the investment we’re making into our technology platforms, of course, around not only our full software stack, but importantly, and what we’re building with autonomy. And as I noted in my opening comments, a lot of work is underway right now in our next-generation platform for new sensor set, updated sensors, I should say, as well as updated compute, which will allow us, as we look at future variants and future products to really over deliver when it comes to the Level 2, Level 3 self-driving feature set and enable our ability to monetize as well. So that we certainly see as part of the business in the long term. And above and beyond self-driving, there are other opportunities to create meaningful recurring revenue. And some of those, we’ve started to launch and initiated already with our insurance product, with some of the financing products that we have. So we do see the business, as you pointed out, very holistically across the life cycle of the products.
John Murphy: Just to follow-up, RJ, you would never cut price on the front end to drive the hardware sale to get the profit back over time on sort of the software and services side over time. You believe you need to earn adequate margins and returns on the front end, even though you have this opportunity in the back end. Is that a fair statement?
RJ Scaringe: For us with the R1 platform, this – our strategy isn’t to – certainly have been to do that. But longer term, as the business evolves, we’ve – and I’m sure we’ll talk about this today in the Q&A portion. We’re putting a tremendous amount of focus on driving cost efficiencies into our R2 platform. That’s how the vehicle is architected. That’s how we’re looking at part consolidation. It’s how we’re thinking about everything from network architecture to easy [ph] topology across the vehicle to drive cost efficiencies to facilitate obviously, a much lower-priced vehicle, but also to give us flexibility in the long-term to look at different revenue streams and different revenue opportunities. But as it stands on R1, as I reiterate at the start, we do see ASP continuing to expand and grow both because of – we’re pulling a new post-March 1 customers as well as the expanded number of offerings that bring in things like Max pack and certainly, we will be continuing to the feature set to allow us to fully access customer demand.
John Murphy: Okay. And if I could just ask one follow-up here on the virtual factory technologies that you used for the Enduro motor launch. Can you just kind of explain what that actually means? And how you can use that in the future and how much that saves you in the launch process as far as time and money?
RJ Scaringe: Yes, this is an important development. Our team has been working hard in its Enduro represents for us really the sort of a full embodiment of what we believe we’re capable of in terms of both product engineering as well as our manufacturing engineering teams and the close integration between those teams led to a lot of innovations, which we’ve talked about in previous calls, in terms of part consolidation and part – or overall design simplification. But what’s not necessarily seen in the product is how we’re manufacturing it and the bring up of this line has gone very smoothly. It’s ahead of schedule. We’re actually ahead of our ramp curve, which is a great thing. But a lot of that’s been facilitated by really careful planning from the teams, but also what I referred to in the opening comments, we’ve developed a platform that allows us to very seamlessly bring up all the PLCs, all the controllers and all the robotics and the equipment associated with that much more seamlessly by creating effectively an extraction layer that we control from a plant software point of view. And we can access equipment much more seamlessly and we can bring up the equipment much more seamlessly than when we’re working through a variety of third-party platforms to do those things.
John Murphy: Very interesting. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Adam Jonas: Hey everybody. So my first question is for Frank. You’re coming up on one year at the company as COO. When you think about the next 12 months, where do you see the greatest opportunity to improve efficiency at Normal? And what would you point out as the greatest risk to execution from here? Thanks, Frank.
Frank Klein: Yes. Thanks, Adam, for the question. I mean my priority, certainly for the next 12 month is to continue focusing on the ramp-up in Normal, certainly driving down the cost, as RJ and Claire already mentioned, and certainly also already preparing the ramp-up of our R2 platform. And this is, I think, will give us a competitive advantage as we are already as a team, jointly together with Nick working on the next generation R2 and really preparing that. And you’ve seen we’ve already, in the last few months shown that we are in line with the expectation on the Q1 production numbers, and we really anticipate continuing the ramp-up of the R1 line. And we will really see in the second half of this year that we should see the numbers being really close to our installed capacity. Again, on the cost initiative, yes, I mean we still see a significant gap on what we should be paying our suppliers and what we’re currently paying. So what we have done in the last few months is starting to engage the discussions with every single supplier and to show them the gap, and we’re working on closing the gap within the next few months. So this is really my priority, I think we have a great plan in place. So right now, for me, it’s literally just executing the plan that we put together as a team.
Adam Jonas: Thanks, Frank. And RJ, just a follow-up for you. Now that you’ve been released some exclusivity on the EDV. Are you able to provide any update on status of discussions with other commercial customers at a high level in the last few months? Thanks.
RJ Scaringe: Thanks, Adam. We’re, at this point, continue to focus from a production point of view on really the single customer with Amazon. And in terms of looking beyond the exclusivity into other customers, we do see a broad set of needs in the commercial space. And as you all know, these are long lead time discussions and negotiations, especially for some of these larger contracts. So those have been underway for some time now, and certainly play into the long-term plan for the platform, and it’s been something we’ve been working very closely with Amazon on to allow us to pursue these other customers as quickly as possible.
Adam Jonas: Thanks, RJ.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line George Gianarikas with Canaccord. Your line is open.
George Gianarikas: Hey good afternoon everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could help us understand a little bit with a little more granularity, some of the leverage you could have to EV commodity prices coming in, you’d mentioned in the past that your contracts from 2018, 2019 are expiring. Any additional color would be greatly appreciated.
RJ Scaringe: This is important. Frank referenced it a bit in his previous comment, but a lot of our – the vast majority of our bill of materials from when we started production, were negotiated in contracts in the 2018, 2019 time frame. So that was a few years before we started production. Certainly, we didn’t have the negotiating leverage that we have today. And as we wind the clock forward through to today, the level of excitement and engagement that we have from suppliers is – it’s absolutely night and day. So there’s a tremendous amount of passion to drive towards – help us drive towards profitability. Really, as the suppliers see us as a significant partner going forward and are excited not just about R1, but are certainly very excited about the R2 platform as well. So as Frank talked about, these are negotiations that are happening real time, and we’re working closely with our partners to find appropriate cost down paths to achieve our targets and to achieve the long-term profitability on R1 but also to set up the relationships to be profitable very rapidly in R2.
George Gianarikas: As a follow-up, asking for Frank, any curious on timing for the Max pack durations [ph] for the R1 platform? Thanks.
Frank Klein: Yes. My dad has been asking me that a lot lately, too. So I think there’s a tremendous amount of excitement for the Max pack and we are working very hard to bring that forward. I think as I noted at the beginning, it certainly also helps us grow ASPs. So there’s a lot of reasons in addition to your friend and my satisfaction of pulling Max pack in as quickly as possible.
George Gianarikas: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Rod Lache: Hi everybody. I know that you are not talking about backlog anymore on the consumer side, but I was hoping, RJ, you might be able to just give us some color, first of all, on what you’re seeing in terms of demand trends on that side of the business?
RJ Scaringe: Sure. Thanks, Rod. Well, backlog still extends well into 2024. I think important to note here is just the engagement we have with customers and the level of satisfaction that our early customers the first 35,000 or so customers are having really creates a powerful flywheel where our biggest, and I would say, most important advocates are the buyers of our vehicles. And so with that said, we continue to see that through the online forms. We see that through the communities that are performing and we even see that through third-party recognition. J.D. Power had is awarded with the highest level of customer satisfaction of any vehicle in the 2023 ratings, which was great, and it’s really reflective of the brand. We’re working so hard to build, but also the experiences we’re trying to create across the full life cycle of the ownership experience. Now with that said, the work that we’re going to continue to do over the course of this year will – and I noted this earlier, will help us expand brand visibility and brand awareness. So the additional physical spaces that we’re building out, the sales infrastructure or service infrastructure that we’re building out will continue to contribute to that, that growing flywheel of awareness and growing flywheel of demand.
Rod Lache: Great. Thanks for that. And Claire, I want to make sure that we’re thinking about the underlying gross profit ex LCNRV impact correctly? Because I think that we’re seeing some signs of improvement here even with the downtime that you took and before – probably before the impact of this the 25% decline in BOM [ph] on the RCV. In the past, you’ve suggested that we look at the difference in the LCNRV charge, so that would be $98 million this quarter. So broad strokes, would you say that on the gross profit line and a clean run rate was a bit over $600 million loss on 8,000 units delivered versus $760 million or so on kind of similar delivery volume last quarter. And is that the run rate from which you’re bridging to breakeven? Or you talked you were referring to the full year guidance?
Claire McDonough: Rod, that’s correct. That’s the run rate that we’re working on. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks on the Q1 walk from current Q1 gross profit, excluding the impact of LCNRV to where we expect to be in Q4 of 2024. And as you rightfully noted, we saw a 17% improvement quarter-over-quarter as we went from Q4 to Q1.
Rod Lache: Okay. So it sounds like you’re confirming that. And is your bridge – are you sort of holding commodities somewhat flat in your guidance bridge? Or how do you sort of think about as we’re seeing lithium carbonate hydroxide costs falling? What – how are you sort of factoring that into your bridges at this point?
Claire McDonough: Sure. The way I would characterize it is within the forecast guide to that Q4 2024, the expectations are for more of a normalized state of commodity costs. So we – said another way, we haven’t expected material reductions in commodity costs, even though we, in the course of the last quarter, have seen significant declines in the cost of lithium carbonate. – in lithium hydroxide as well.
Rod Lache: Great. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. 
Alex Potter: Great. Thanks guys. So my first question is on the 25% reduction in the bill of materials as a result of the LFP pack and Enduro, which I think is an interesting data point. You expect something similar when you start rolling those technologies out with R1? And if that comes alongside a price hike, it seems like the impact on gross margin could be pretty material. I just don’t know if it has such a big impact on the bill of materials for R1 as well.
RJ Scaringe: Yes, Alex, thanks for the question. As Claire noted, we’re excited to see the 25% reduction that we referenced starts to make its way into the numbers in Q2 as the EDV line comes back on, and we’ll see those numbers in Q2. But for R1, this is a really important development. It’s part of a broader set of developments that when we talk about a lot of the R&D work on the innovation that we’re driving a big portion of this is focused on driving cost out, driving simplification of the product and I’d like to invite Nick just to talk a bit about some of the work that we’re doing there, inclusive of Enduro, but there’s a host of other work streams that we’re going to start to see come to light.
Nick Kalayjian: Yes. Thanks, RJ. So the Enduro drive unit is a significantly less expensive product and diversifies our supply chain, which brings additional value. When we think about the EDV experience that we’ve been able to deliver on over the last quarter with the ramp of Enduro and the integration of LFP. And that 25% reduction is really impactful, and we expect to see something similar in R1 as we look over the next couple of quarters in the beginning of next year.
Alex Potter: Okay. Great. Second question on CapEx. I saw that you maintained the $2 billion guidance, but that’s a pretty – that implies, I guess, a pretty material step up versus what you spent in Q1. So just wondering maybe qualitatively and/or quantitatively, if you can talk through what that money is earmarked for in the back half? And if there’s any potential to maybe defer some of that in order to protect the cash balance? Thanks. 
Claire McDonough: Sure, Alex. As we think about the cadence of our CapEx, as you can imagine, with the $2 billion guide that we have, that implies significantly higher levels of CapEx over the remaining three quarters of the year. And for us, our expectation is, we’re going to make significant investments, predominantly in tooling as we think about some of the next-generation technologies that will start to be introduced throughout the course of 2023. And then importantly, as we’ve talked about in prior earnings calls before – throughout the course of 2024 as well.  And so I would say that’s one of the primary drivers of our CapEx spend. Beyond that, there’s incremental payments associated with the commissioning and utilization of our Enduro line, where we have the lines fully running today, but all of that cash is not yet out the door at Rivian. And then beyond that, as RJ alluded to continued build-out of our go-to-market infrastructure as we’re building out incremental service centers, charging network, things of that nature as we continue to grow and scale the business in aggregate. Based off of your second part of your question on availability to defer CapEx, given the sort of lumpy nature of our CapEx deployment and spend, there certainly is some likelihood especially as we think about some of the Georgia CapEx initiation that some of that could fall into 2024 relative to 2023.
Alex Potter: Perfect. Thanks guys. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of Dan Levy with Barclays. Your line is open. 
Dan Levy: Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking the question. First I want to ask about the constraints that Normal. In the past, I think you said the largest constraint on production was on power semi. So just want to get a sense of where that stands. And we’ve heard about tightness on silicon carbide, I know you used both silicon carbide and IGBT, but how much is the tight silicon carbide supply still a challenge for you?
RJ Scaringe: Thanks, Dan. One of the things we’ve sort of embedded in our comments here and that we should add some more color to is with the bring up of the Enduro drive unit, it doesn’t – it’s not only providing us with a lower-cost propulsion platform, but it also helps us diversify our supply chain with regards to the power modules. So bringing on additional suppliers of both silicon IGBT, but also silicon carbide and that was very intentional. And we’ve designed the ramp-up of that such that it helps alleviate some of the constraints we have on our existing quad motor silicon carbide supply, which we’ve talked about in the past as being one of the major ramp constraints. This is also something that as we look forward into R2, we’re spending a lot of time on to make sure that these constraints aren’t there. And Nick’s team in designing our next-generation inverters and power modules have spent a tremendous amount of effort to ensure that we really consider some of the long-term constraints that we see in this space.
Nick Kalayjian: I think the comments earlier about when we sourced a lot of the components for R1 are really relevant in power semis as well. The supply base for our original launch configuration was a relatively smaller set of players than who we’re working with today for both silicon and silicon carbide. And as we move into Enduro and we move into those larger, more mature suppliers, we build out that capacity today, and we build those relationships towards the future as we think about our R2.
Dan Levy: So is it fair to say that as you’re sort of addressing the silicon carbide issue in a variety of ways and then as this is addressed, your patent production should increase dramatically, which is implied, I think, within your guidance in any case?
RJ Scaringe: Yes, that’s right. 
Dan Levy: Okay. Great. Thank you. Second question, and I think you’ve addressed this somewhat with Enduro and LFP, but wondering what other opportunities you have with vehicle to potentially de-content further or to help reduce the material costs? I know you’ve talked about working with suppliers to try to cut away some of the costs. But within the engineering of R1 itself, what other opportunities might there be to de-content to help improve the path to breakeven?
Nick Kalayjian: Yes. So Enduro and LFP are clearly big pieces of the puzzle. And I think we tend to talk about those because they’re customer-facing. We’re offering different range packs and drift and driving configurations. There’s a lot of work that’s also going on under the covers to make sure that we have continued cost reduction. RJ has talked in the past about moving to a zonal architecture, which really has a significant impact on the number of ECUs in the vehicle. The complexity and cost of the harness. And those both have significant impacts with Frank in the factory on our ability to reduce labor content in the vehicles. We also are looking at a series of body manufacturing updates late this year, updates to joining technology and materials to help improve yield and lower cost. We have a new part of the Max pack and the Large pack platform coming early next year that involves some significant changes to the battery structure that really pull out costs and again drive up manufacturability. So again, some of these are really customer-facing things, but – our goal is to offer better value to customers. And then some of these things like the zonal architecture are success means nobody notices that we’ve made all these changes under the hood.
RJ Scaringe: I think the other thing just to note, Nick referred to and I referred to it, the updates we’re making to our network architecture really laid the groundwork for what we’re doing with R2. And one of the benefits of developing the – all the electronics in the vehicle and of course, the software stack in the vehicles. As we’ve now reached a level of maturity, we’re consolidating a number of those ECUs and removing not only a lot of these use from the vehicle while maintaining feature set, but also along with that, massively simplifying the vehicle harness. And all that work flows very naturally into R2, so we not only pay costs out of R1, but we derisk the launch of R2.
Dan Levy: Great. So number of [indiscernible] that. Got it. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho Group. Your line is open. 
Vijay Rakesh: Yes. Hi. Just a couple of quick questions. On the Enduro dual-motor, Enduro and the LFP, what mix are you assuming of your shipments or deliveries will be on those as you ramp those to the year or?
RJ Scaringe: In the case of our commercial vans, 100% of the commercial vans are moving to LFP pack configuration and the Enduro drive unit. As it pertains to the R1 platform, we expect a drive train level between what we call our origin, the quad motor and Enduro, the dual-motor to be about a 50-50 split. We have the flexibility within our production capabilities to flex that up or down some. But as you heard from myself and Frank earlier, the supply chain constraints around the power semi is really a key consideration and that flexibility of our production lines to respond to any supply constraints that may come up is really important. Now in the case of our R1 battery pack, we will be introducing what we call our standard pack, but that’s going to be a little later than this year.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And on the – you mentioned the higher ASP sales. Just wondering how that is ramping. Is all your deliveries post-March 31st to April 1st on the hire ASP vehicles or...
RJ Scaringe: Yes. The pre-March first vehicles have a lower price point. And we’re actively with every vehicle we deliver of those, we – it’s one less, and we start to work towards a growing mix of post-March 1 reservations and progress [ph]. So over the course of really the next year, we hope to work through those pre-March 1st quarters and get into newer post March 1, 2022 orders. 
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. Thank you. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Tom Narayan with RBC Capital. Your line is open. 
Tom Narayan: Hi, yes. Thanks for the taking the question. And apologies if you answered this, just a quick question on the guidance, the EBITDA guidance. If I take the Q1 adjusted EBITDA and annualize it, I get a number that’s only, I think, 6% below your full year guide. I know deliveries should probably ramp higher and you have these cost outs. Just curious as to maybe is there a quarterly cadence dynamic that’s leading to that EBITDA guidance for the full year?
Claire McDonough: Sure, Tom. As we think about the overall EBITDA cadence overall, it’s driven by a couple of key factors. First and foremost, while we’ll be improving our overall cost of goods sold per unit, we are still running at a loss position throughout the course of 2023. And so as we go throughout the course of the year this year, we’ll see some variability, both in terms of how rapidly we’re taking down the LCNRV charges throughout the course of the year, which is one factor as it pertains to our adjusted EBITDA that we’ll be reporting. And then the other factor that we’ll have as well is really as we think about sort of the three key drivers as ramp material costs at ASP and the trajectory that we expect to see as we continuously improve on each of those core drivers as the year progresses on, but we’ll be delivering greater volumes of vehicles albeit at lower loss positions as we continue to scale throughout the year.
Tom Narayan: Okay. And just kind of a high-level question. wondering for RJ, wondering how you think about the kind of long-term market opportunity for your consumer offering in light of what appears to be maybe increasing competition from legacy OEMs particularly in trucks and SUVs. Does that change kind of how you view the market opportunity longer term? Or do you view it as kind of different kind of world. Certainly, these legacy OEMs are getting more competitive with – specifically with EVs across these vehicles?
RJ Scaringe: Yes. Thanks, Tom. Yes, today, with the R1 product, we’re seeing demand relative to others that are in similar segments or similar price points, it’s significantly outpacing sort of similarly priced vehicles. So at this price point, the R1 platforms, really the leader in terms of overall share. And that level of excitement and demand that we’re seeing there is reflective of the way we’ve approached the brand and the features and the overall product design. And of course, we hope to carry that into much lower price point with the R2 platform. And the R2 platform, while it we’ll have a number of other players that are offering products that are in that price range of $40,000 to $50,000. The way we’re thinking about it and the things we’re excited about with regards to the product is just how unique we can make it in terms of capturing the core essence of everything we’ve shown with the flagship product with a product that ultimately delivers on a high level of performance, both on and off road, a tremendous amount of capability and the ability to sort of enable and inspire folks to take the kinds of ventures where you need to fit your pets, your kids your gear into the vehicle. So we, of course, haven’t shown R2 yet. We’ve all seen it. So we’re – we have asymmetric information on what it looks like and what it is. But I can say we have a tremendous amount of confidence around the product we’re developing and how that not only fits our brand so nicely, but we think really provides an extension to the addressable market relative to what we’ve done with R1.
Frank Klein: Yes. I think quarter sorry, it’s important as well to extend the vision of what we’re doing well beyond the electric powertrain. Legacy OEMs are moving in this direction, which is great for the overall mission. But we really do focus on that overall customer experience and what we can deliver with a combined hardware, software platform. The fact that we’ve been shipping a product for less than two years and influencer like Marcus Brown, he would say best SUV in the world. We have a software experience and overall customer experience that we’re really proud of, and we think differentiates beyond just being an electric vehicle.
Tom Narayan: Yes. I guess, relative today, we haven’t really seen what the legacy OEMs have done yet, right? I mean a lot of these launches are still yet to come. 2024, specifically, we’re going to see a couple more – and then obviously, as we get further in the decade, that’s what I was referring to. I mean today, obviously, it’s not as robust, especially in the U.S., but in the coming years, you – I would think that competition intensifies more. That’s kind of what I was referring to.
RJ Scaringe: I think the other thing to keep in mind and Nick references, is in the not-too-distant future, everything will be electric. So being electric alone isn’t a sufficient differentiation point. It really ties into the – ultimately what’s the way the product comes together, the interplay between software, the electronics in the vehicle, of course, the dynamic performance of the vehicle, the packaging and the architecture of the vehicle. And Frank referred to and I referred to it, but how manufacturable the vehicle, which ultimately drives the cost structure for what we’re building. So given the significant change in the electrication offers, though, it does create new opportunities in terms of how we architect the vehicle, how we design the cost structure and then the types of driving dynamics and experiences that can be delivered.
Tom Narayan: All right. Great. Thanks. 
Operator: Thank you. Our next question coming from the line of James Picariello with BNP Paribas. Your line is open. Jim, your line is open. 
James Picariello: I think the reception cut out for me. Can you hear me?
RJ Scaringe: Yes. We can. Yes. 
James Picariello: Okay. I think this was asked, but I just want to clarify, given the 25% bond savings, it will be meaningful – as we think about next year, what could the mix of your total R1 production be tied to LFP and Enduro, I imagine you have some visibility into that based on your reservations. And – can you just remind us if there’s going to be an impact to the lines as you integrate into on LFP and into R1 similar to what we saw for EDV this past quarter? Thanks. 
RJ Scaringe: As I referenced, we expect from an Enduro, so the dual motor versus the quad motor on our one to be roughly a 50-50 split. And in the case of commercial vans, 100% of those will be with the Enduro Drive unit. In terms of how we plan to ramp up R1 with Enduro, it’s important to note that while we brought the EDV line down in Q1 for the integration of both Enduro and the LFP was also we were bringing up the Enduro line and the significant cost savings that, that propulsion package delivered really led us to make the decision to bring on EDV while we brought those lines up and ramped them. I’d like to just invite Frank to have a few comments on the ramp of Enduro and how that now will soon be feeding R1 as well as EDV and I referenced this before, but a big part of it beyond just plant software, beyond the equipment, beyond the design of the product is also the operations and the team and how the team is working and how we’ve set up training and the programs around that.
Nick Kalayjian: Yes. Thanks, RJ. I mean, the Enduro ramp-up, we started production at the beginning of February and we’re already exceeding our anticipated ramp-up curve. So from ramping up the Enduro, I don’t see significant challenges ahead of us. And the differentiating factor between introducing EDV, the Enduro into the EDV versus R1 is that on the EDV, we did shut down the line. And on R1, we plan on continuing producing the R1 while we are introducing the Enduro motors into the R1 product. We’ve already actually built several Enduro Motors into the R1, just to really test the production, and it really works seamlessly. So I don’t see a major impact on the ramp-up curve of the R1 as we introduce Enduro as a significant change to the R1 product. 
RJ Scaringe: Yes. As Frank said, the one – the Enduro has been we’ve introduced – we’ve produced quite a few, and we’re bleeding or blending those into the line for R1. I can I’ve been driving an Enduro, R1S now for the past month, and it’s really incredible. I can’t wait for customers to get their hands on it. So as Frank said, the risk around the Enduro bring up in R1 is really well managed and we’ve been very intentional around how we’ve ramped that line and how we plan the integration of Enduro into R1.
Nick Kalayjian: And we have really put a lot of emphasis in preparing the team and training the team offline and online to make sure that the team is capable and ready to ramp up our one with the Enduro motor as well. 
James Picariello: Got it. That’s super helpful. And then just two quick ones. Is the first half of next year, still the time frame for normal capacity re-rating to the R1 and then is there any update on the Georgia plant incentives outcome? Thank you. 
RJ Scaringe: Yes, on the first question, yes, that is the plan. We plan on re-rating there R1 line in 2024 as we also use that opportunity to modify the line to incorporate the technical changes that Nick mentioned. So this will happen in 2024. So we’re already in preparation of this on the one hand, with the equipment suppliers preparing the team. So that’s going according to plan.
Claire McDonough: And then on your second question on Georgia-related incentives. A couple of weeks ago, the Georgia all it court sided with the state in a ruling over the tax abatement for the project and ruled in favor of the state’s position. So the tax fund four of the five aspects of the appeal, the court ruled in favor of Georgia and therefore, Rivian’s benefit as part of that ruling overall. So great momentum as we sit here today on progress in Georgia.
James Picariello: Understood. Thank you. Congrats. 
Operator: Thank you. And our next question coming from the line of Jordan Levy with Truist. Your line is now open. Jordan Levy, your line is open. 
Jordan Levy: Apologies my cut off for a second. I’m wondering just quickly if we could talk about the build-out of the adventure network and the importance of growing that and any potential benefits that might be able to be realized from the IRA as you build that out?
RJ Scaringe: Yes. Thanks, Jordan. We’re excited about building out more of our RAN network or Rivian Adventure Network. And today, we’ve been deploying into what we think it was like the first batch of sites to really ensure the uptime ensure the equipment is working as planned. And just as reference, this is the charging increment, the DC fast chargers. We’ve designed those internally, we also build those in normal. So we have a production line dedicated to building those charters. We’re going through making some updates to the product as well to facilitate it becoming an open network. And Nick, this is something your team is working really hard on. We just had a review on it last week. It’s – I couldn’t be more excited about getting more of these out there. Can you just provide some more commentary on some of the work that you’re doing there?
Nick Kalayjian: Yes, sure. So just to put some numbers behind it, we have 27 sites open today, which represents about 150 chargers in locations across the country. We’ve picked these to be sort of relevant to our customer base as we think about routes from places like the Bay Area Tahoe or LA up to Mammoth. Those units as already referenced, are showing really strong uptime and that’s really the key. The customer feedback about the overall user experience has been excellent. The number one complaint is why aren’t there more of them. So that’s what we’re working hard to accomplish, but we really want to scale that based on solid data that we have, the uptime that we’re going to have a dependable network. And then we expect later this year, we’ll be able to accelerate the number of installs and then again, continue that some minor modifications to the equipment to be able to open the network up beyond Rivian customers.
Claire McDonough: And we look forward to be in a position to take advantage of that money funding, there’s $5 billion of net funding available. And then in addition to that, the charging and fueling infrastructure program, which has an incremental $2.5 billion available. So we’re excited to use some of those government grants to accelerate our rollout of the RAN network.
RJ Scaringe: And we’re uniquely positioned because U.S. produce chargers at our Normal facility.
Jordan Levy: Thanks so much. 
Operator: Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to RJ Scaringe for any closing remarks.
RJ Scaringe: Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call. We enjoyed talking about some of the progress we made in the last quarter. We’re certainly, as you heard from all of us, very much looking forward to the quarters and years ahead.  We have a lot of work to do in terms of continuing to drive our production ramp and drive costs down. We’re operating with an incredible level of focus and urgency as we drive towards that. But the excitement that we’re seeing from customers and the passion that we’re seeing from customers that want to get future products is certainly innovating force for all of us within Rivian. And we’re looking forward to continuing to show progress quarter-over-quarter as we work towards not all profitability, but significantly higher volumes. So thank you, everyone for joining and look forward to the next call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
1492,ON,2,2023,2023-07-31 12:44:02,"Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the onsemi Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers’ presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today’s conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your host today, Parag Agarwal, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead.

Now, let me turn it over to Hassane. Hassane?
Hassane El-Khoury: Thank you, Parag. Good morning, and thanks to everyone on the call for joining us. The executive staff and I are thrilled with the results following another successful quarter for onsemi with Q2 revenue of $2.09 billion and non-GAAP gross margins of 47.4%, both above the midpoint of our guidance. Our worldwide teams are firing on all cylinders, well, maybe I should start saying they're spinning all motors now. Our approach of disciplined, consistent and reliable execution continues to be the winning formula for onsemi quarter-after-quarter. We have again exceeded our targets, despite the current market environment, all while delivering best-in-class performance for our customers. The most recent example is our silicon carbide performance. We ramped a new and highly complex technology, while continuing to surpass internal manufacturing and financial metrics and we are all very proud of everyone that contributes to its success daily. Given our progress in Q2 silicon carbide revenue growing nearly 4x over Q2 '22, we remain on track to achieve our first $1 billion revenue year and remain on track to have more than 50% of our substrates coming from our internal production by the end of Q4. EV is the fastest growing part of this business, followed by energy infrastructure. Customers are excited to work with us. Our successful capacity expansion is creating an opportunity for onsemi to gain share in silicon carbide by supporting new demand amid ongoing supply uncertainty in this space. In Q2 alone, we signed more than $3 billion of new Silicon Carbide LTSAs, bringing our total lifetime Silicon Carbide revenue committed through long-term supply agreements to over $11 billion. One of our largest wins last quarter was with Vitesco, a leader in modern drive technologies and electrification solutions, who signed a $1.9 billion agreement to support their growing need for silicon carbide in electric vehicles. They are co-investing $250 million as part of this 10-year LTSA to ensure capacity for the ramp. We also extended our silicon carbide engagement with BorgWarner to integrate our EliteSiC 1200 and 750 volt power devices into its power modules to deliver increased power density and higher efficiency, which increase the range and overall performance of EVs. We have had a longstanding relationship with BorgWarner and this extended LTSA now amounts to $1 billion of committed silicon carbide revenue. Finally, with Magna, one of the world's largest automotive suppliers, we have signed a silicon carbide LTSA to expand our strategic collaboration, which has long included technologies across our intelligent power and sensing portfolio. Together, we will integrate our 1200 volt intelligent power devices into Magna's traction inverter solutions to improve the performance of electric vehicles over the next 10 years. By integrating onsemi's industry-leading EliteSiC technology, Magna e-drive systems will deliver greater cooling performance and faster acceleration and charging rate that will help improve efficiency and increase the range of EVs. In addition, they will co-invest $40 million in new silicon carbide equipment in our Hudson and Czech Republic locations to ensure access to future supply. LTSAs have become an integral part of the way we do business with our strategic customers. LTSAs continue to provide us with extended visibility, stability in pricing and volume commitments, while allowing us to plan for long-term capacity. In terms of market dynamics, both automotive and industrial remained healthy in Q2 with quarter-over-quarter growth of 8% and 10% respectively, and now account for 80% of our total revenue. It was the first time that our automotive revenue surpassed the $1 billion mark in a single quarter driven by strength in intelligent power for electric vehicles and intelligent sensing for advanced safety applications. New regional regulations will require that vehicles be equipped with both a wider field of view to detect vulnerable road users such as pedestrian and cyclists, as well as high speed electronic braking for highways. These new standards can only be met with higher resolution image sensors, like the eight megapixel device, which we first introduced two years ago and is now widely adopted by top car makers for production in their 2024 models. With this accelerated adoption, we expect our 2023 revenue for our eight megapixel image sensors to more than double year-over-year. We have further expanded our intelligence sensing portfolio with the newly introduced Hyperlux Family of image sensors for automotive and industrial markets, designed to eliminate flicker, all while delivering the highest dynamic range available in the market. For industrial applications such as surveyance and machine vision, our new products also offer very low power with intelligent Wake-on-Motion to even further extend energy savings. Another significant milestone this quarter is the sampling of our automotive-grade image sensor out of our East Fishkill fab to leading global ADAS customers and partners, making onsemi the only image sensing supplier with a U.S. based 300-millimeter fab in both internal and external sources across every step of the imaging supply chain. Customers value the investments onsemi has made to improve supply resiliency. With evolving vehicle requirements and consumer behavior, automotive design cycles are getting shorter and continue to get compressed. Therefore, we must remain at the forefront of the latest trends and regulations, and ahead of our customers' need. We are innovating with the best in the world and being recognized for the value we provide. Most recently, we received a prestigious Volkswagen Group Award for Innovation for our strategic partnership on future electric vehicles with our broad portfolio of intelligent power, intelligent sensing technologies, along with our focus on establishing vertically integrated silicon carbide production capabilities. We are grateful for partners like VW, as well as our other strategic customers who trust onsemi's packaging expertise, scalable manufacturing capabilities and problem solving approach to deliver joint innovation in the rapidly evolving automotive market. In Industrial, our revenue grew 5% year-over-year and 10% sequentially, with continued strength in medical application, as well as energy infrastructure, which increased nearly 70% year-over-year in Q2. Our growth in the Industrial segment is driven by the accelerated adoption of high growth energy infrastructure applications like solar inverters, energy storage inverters and EV fast chargers. Solar is forecasted to surpass coal and gas in installed capacity by 2027. And onsemi has the number one market share position with a full suite of silicon, silicon carbide and packaging technologies to deliver the most highly efficient and system optimized solutions to customers. We have now secured $1.95 billion in long-term supply agreements for power modules with leading global manufacturers of solar inverters, among which are eight of the top 10 solar inverter suppliers. These customers are securing supply assurance to support their growth. Highlights in medical, include market expansion for continuous glucose monitors or CGMs, driven by the reimbursement of monitoring therapies. We are number one in CGMs, which we support with our sensor interface portfolio. And we expect this market to continue to grow at a 20% CAGR over the next five years. In hearing aids, we have partners with innovative customers, who will push accelerated adoption in the market with over the counter solutions, improving accessibility and lowering cost of ownership. Lexie Hearing is one of the world's game changers in hearing aids and uses onsemi's intelligent sensing technology at the heart of their solution, earning them recognition as one of Time 100's Most Influential Companies in 2023. Once again, I want to thank all our employees who work on our incredible silicon carbide effort around the world, as well as those who remained focused on all of our other strategic growth areas of intelligent power and sensing. We have a unique opportunity as a company to accelerate our investments in areas where we believe we can outpace the market with the capital generated by our mature and growing businesses. The size and scale of our operation have allowed us to leverage our infrastructure and expertise inside the company to tackle complex problems and drive increased output to support the growing needs of our customers. And now, let me turn the call over to Thad to give you more details on our results. Thad?
Thad Trent: Thanks, Hassane. We're pleased to report another stellar quarter for onsemi. Our Q2 results and our Q3 outlook clearly demonstrate our consistent execution, outpacing the industry while navigating the soft macro environment. We are uniquely positioned as our business has been powered by multiple secular growth drivers in the fastest growing end-markets of Automotive and Industrial. All our Q2 financial metrics exceeded the midpoint of our guidance. We grew revenue 7% sequentially, expanded gross margin by 60 basis points to 47.4%, and delivered a 12% quarter-over-quarter increase in earnings per share to $1.33, which exceeded our guidance range. Our global teams have transformed the business to deliver predictable and sustainable performance with above industry growth at attractive margins. Revenue for the second quarter was $2.09 billion, roughly flat compared to the second quarter of 2022 and increased 7% over Q1. The sequential increase was driven by growth in the Automotive and Industrial end markets, with accelerating demand for electrification and renewable energy. Even without silicon carbide, our revenue increased at an impressive pace sequentially. Turning to silicon carbide. Hassane mentioned our continued execution and increasing number of LTSAs with automotive and energy infrastructure customers. We are ramping our silicon carbide production to support the increasing demand and remained ahead of our internal plans. Over the past two years, we have made strategic brownfield investments to expand capacity and ramp production much faster by leveraging our existing manufacturing footprint and expertise. These industry leading ROIC investments are now contributing to our financial results. In the second quarter, our silicon carbide business nearly doubled gross margins sequentially. And I'm proud to report our silicon carbide business achieved its first profitable quarter, delivering high-teen operating margin on a fully loaded basis, which includes all start-up cost. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank the 33,000 onsemi employees across the globe for their commitment to success and delivering outstanding results quarter-after-quarter. Turning to end-markets. Our Automotive revenue hit a new record of over $1 billion in Q2, growing 8% quarter-over-quarter and 35% year-over-year, driven by the accelerating adoption of electrification and the continued need for sensing in vehicles. In Q2, Industrial revenue grew 5% year-over-year and 10% sequentially, with continued strength in EV charging, medical applications, as well as energy infrastructure, which increased nearly 70% year-over-year and is now a meaningful part of our overall revenue. We continue to exit volatile non-core businesses, which included another $57 million in Q2 revenue, bringing our total year-to-date of exited revenue to more than $100 million and nearly $400 million since the start of our transformation. We will continue to be opportunistic in non-core markets, where margins are favorable and engagements are strategic with our customers. We now expect to exit $350 million to $400 million in 2023. Looking at the split between operating units, revenue for the Power Solutions Group or PSG was $1.12 billion, an increase of 6% year-over-year, with more than 60% year-over-year increase in auto and nearly 70% year-over-year increase in energy infrastructure. Revenue for the Advanced Solutions Group or ASG was $650 million, a 9% decline over Q2 '22, driven by deliberate exits and continued softness in non-core markets, offset by strength in Automotive and Industrial. Revenue for the Intelligent Sensing Group or ISG was $325 million, a 4% increase year-over-year, primarily due to the Automotive shift to higher value sensors in our portfolio, such as eight megapixel image sensors. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin of 47.4% improved 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter driven by silicon carbide and despite the significant headwinds from EFK we disclosed last quarter. We continue to improve the cost structure of the fab, but we expect EFK to be dilutive to gross margins by approximately 250 basis points for the next several quarters. We remain committed to maintaining our long-term gross margin trajectory as we execute our Fab Right strategy of driving efficiencies and further consolidation in our internal, as well as our external manufacturing network. Now, let me give you some additional numbers for your models. GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $318.7 million as compared to $453.1 million in the second quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $305.5 million as compared to $317.7 million in the quarter a year ago. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 32.2% and non-GAAP operating margin was 32.8%. Non-GAAP operating margin increased 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter. Our GAAP tax rate was 15.3% and our non-GAAP tax rate was 15.8%. GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter was $1.29 as compared to $1.02 in the quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was $1.33, flat year-over-year and above the high end of our guidance. Our GAAP diluted share count was 448.7 million shares, and our non-GAAP diluted share count was 438.7 million shares. In Q2, we repurchased $60 million of shares at an average price of $86.49 per share. And we remained committed to our long-term strategy of returning 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents was $2.6 billion and we had $1.1 billion undrawn on our revolver. In Q2, we proactively downsized our revolver by $500 million to $1.5 billion and extended the maturity to 2028 to align to our long-term needs and projected cash flow. Cash from operations was $390.8 million and free cash flow was negative at $39.8 million due to timing of investments in capital expenditures and growth in strategic inventory in the second quarter. We expect free cash flow to return to positive for the remainder of the year. Capital expenditures during Q2 were $430.6 million, which equates to a capital intensity of 20.6%. As we indicated previously, we are directing a significant portion of our capital expenditures towards silicon carbide and enabling our 300 millimeter capabilities at EFK and expect our capital intensity to be in the mid to high teen percentage range for the next several quarters. Accounts receivable of $944.4 million, increased by $63.5 million, and DSO was 41 days, consistent with the first quarter. Inventory increased by $149.5 million sequentially and days of inventory increased by four days to 163 days. This includes approximately 54 days of bridged inventory to support fab transition and the silicon carbide ramp. Excluding these strategic builds, our base inventory declined seven days quarter-over-quarter. We continue to proactively manage distribution inventory. Distribution inventory increased $20 million sequentially with weeks of inventory at 7.7 weeks in Q2 versus seven weeks in Q1. Total debt remained flat at $3.5 billion and net leverage is 0.27. Let me now provide you key elements of our non-GAAP guidance for the third quarter. A table detailing our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance is provided in the press release related to our second quarter results. Our business continues to strengthen with improved visibility, and we expect to recognize approximately $6.4 billion of committed revenue from our LTSAs over the next 12 months in addition to our non-cancelable and non-returnable orders. Given the soft macro environment, we are taking a cautious stance in our guidance. We anticipate Q3 revenue will be in the range of $2.095 billion to $2.195 billion. We expect Automotive and Industrial to increase quarter-over-quarter with other markets down mid to high-single digits, as we plan further exits in our non-core markets. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 46% and 48% due to lower factory utilization, EFK headwinds and the dilutive impact of silicon carbide, which remains ahead of plan. This also includes share-based compensation of $4.4 million. As we have previously stated, 2023 will be a transition year for our gross margin and we expect to maintain our trajectory as we manage these temporary headwinds. We expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $300 million to $315 million, including share-based compensation of $29 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP OIE will be negligible for the quarter. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% and our non-GAAP diluted share count for the third quarter is expected to be approximately 439 million shares. This results in non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $1.27 to $1.41. We expect capital expenditures of $440 million to $480 million, primarily in Brownfield investments in silicon carbide and EFK. To wrap up, the structural changes we've been implementing since the start of our transformation have improved the resiliency of our business and enabled us to better navigate the soft market environment. We have delivered another quarter with results above expectations, reinforcing that consistent, reliable execution is our path forward to achieving our long-term model. We have reduced the volatility in our financials and held to our commitments while navigating short-term market dynamics and we plan to continue to deliver for our shareholders one quarter at a time. With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Liz to open for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Chris Danley with Citi. Christian, line is now open.
Unidentified Participant: Hey. [indiscernible] here for Chris Danley. Sorry, you went dark for a second. Hey, guys. My first question is just on the overall cycle, Hassan, how would you compare taking silicon carbide out, just pure semis now versus three months ago. Would you say it's gotten a little better, a little worse? Any comments on visibility and just the overall semi cycle now versus last quarter at this point?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yeah. I mean I'll tell you auto and industrial remains healthy. Even if you take out silicon carbide, that business is up. And that's really the way we position those -- both of these businesses in a lot of the mega trends that are underlying it with the EV and energy infrastructure. So when you put both of those without silicon carbide, that's also supporting growth in general for our, what I would call the silicon business. So strength in these markets is sustained.
Unidentified Participant: And how about non-auto industrial?
Hassane El-Khoury: Auto and industrial, we'll see it slightly down, flat slightly down. And that's a lot of our peers that are more exposed to those businesses are seeing and we see the same thing.
Thad Trent: Yeah. And for [indiscernible] our non-auto and industrial was up slightly, but as Hassane said, we expect it to be down mid to high-single digits in Q3.
Unidentified Participant: Yeah. Great. And for my follow-up, any changes in -- on specific lead times and shortages quarter-over-quarter? Has your lead times gone down, gone up -- stayed the same, shortages up, down, stayed the same versus three months ago?
Thad Trent: Yeah. On the lead times, if you look at our average lead time, it’s very consistent quarter-on-quarter. There’s been pockets where lead times have decreased a few pockets where they’ve increased. But on average, they’re relatively flat quarter-on-quarter.
Unidentified Participant: Great. Thanks, guys.
Thad Trent: Thanks.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
Blake Friedman: This is Blake Friedman on from Vivek Arya. Thanks for taking my question. So first, I just want to start off with that onsemi has signed a number of silicon carbide LTSAs. So I was hoping you could provide the mix of autos versus non-autos? And then looking further into the industrial market, your growth is up 5% year-on-year, which is certainly well above other peers down 10% to 20%. And I know silicon carbide is a partial contributor. But I was hoping you can describe maybe what you're seeing versus what peers aren't?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yeah. A couple of things. On the silicon carbide, it's still within the same mix, we've talked about before about 90% is auto, about 10% is industrial. The LTSA that we talked about in Industrial are the $1.95 billion, that's for the whole market. So that includes silicon and silicon carbide or IGBT because we talked about the hybrid modules, we're able to provide that's driving that $1.95. On the industrial side, specifically, what really breaks us apart is the fact that we are extremely focused on the growth markets within industrial. We talked about energy infrastructure, which includes renewable and includes charging all of that, that is driven -- those are mega trends underlying the industrial and in my prepared remarks, I talked about our focus on the medical side of the business, which is also under the industrial. And that's seen, its own transformation from the hearing aid going over to counter to CGM being part of the reimbursement scenarios. All of these are driving underlying growth, but they're very specific to where we have chosen to put our strategy from a company perspective, that's where our investments have been and the growth is coming specifically. So that's the reason I can pinpoint exactly what is specific to onsemi versus the general peers.
Blake Friedman: Got it. And then as a follow-up, I was just hoping you can provide an update on the progress of in-sourcing silicon carbide substrates and your time line to be fully in-sourced. And I understand the strategy has been focusing on brownfield investments, but with industry silicon carbide supply expected to trail demand for the foreseeable future. Would management ever consider building its own greenfield facility down the road?
Hassane El-Khoury: So the -- I'll answer both of these separately. So the progress is still on track. I reiterated the fact that we're going to be exiting this year with majority coming internally. So we're still on track. That business is actually -- that operation is actually performing better than we expected. So high confidence in our commitment that we've made about six months to nine months ago, so we're going to exit this year with majority internal. As far as Brownfield, Greenfield, we have a lot of runway with the Brownfield. We have a great fab and back end exposure. And what we're doing is, we're going to utilize it. We don't see that needing to go to greenfield at any time in the future. Of course, that's dependent on business and economic sense. Right now, with all the wins that we have disclosed, those are we are able to support those with Brownfield, specifically as we embark on our fab right strategy that Thad described in our Analyst Day that's going to be supporting all the LTSAs that we've disclosed. And look, if business is even better than what we are talking about today, and we have to go to Greenfield, then that's a really good reason to do it. But for now, Brownfield is the path and we're able to support it. And that’s really highlights the good ROIC that we’ve been able to deliver.
Blake Friedman: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.
Harsh Kumar: Hey, guys. Can you hear me, okay?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yeah.
Harsh Kumar: Okay. Hey, guys. First all, congratulations. This is yet another fantastic quarter and guide from you guys, so congratulations. And I had two questions, Hassane. I'm seeing a little bit of a change in your business. I used to see sort of transactional business in silicon carbide, you get -- you’ll get orders, you get customers, but now we're seeing really large orders, really large customers, multiyear, multibillion-dollar deals. Is this happening because of the competitive environment recently or is this happening because you are much more comfortable taking on these orders? And if so, why are you more comfortable taking on these kind of orders? And then I know you've said that you never want to sell wafers, but I just want to clarify, are these orders strictly all 100% chips or is there a portion of wafers you're involved as well? And then I've got a follow-up.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yeah. So let me answer the latter part because that's straightforward. We're still not interested in selling what we call substrates we're not in the business of substrate. Our focus on the substrate manufacturing is for internal consumption, that has not changed. And look, the demand that we've been talking about utilizes all of our substrate operations. So we're increasing that capacity in tandem just ahead of our revenue or the ramp from our customers. That remains unchanged and that remains our focus. And the operation is performing ahead of plan. So I'm very, very satisfied with what the team has done there. As far as the strategic engagements with the customer, it's not our -- it's not only our willingness to take that business on. We've always been willing and we've talked very confidently about our capabilities and what we have been ramping. What is changing is, if you think about the landscape, we have -- we are the only one that's scaled very quickly and is a silicon carbide supplier at scale. And that is now very, very clear to our customers and their customers, whether it's Tier 1 or an OEM and that ability to scale and really deliver exactly on our commitments to all the customers who had a LTSAs with us have gotten what they want, no hiccups in ramp, no hiccups in technology, no hiccups in expansion. So they're coming back and expanding those agreements because they're winning more business with our products and they want to secure more of their future. So it's a win-win, really and it's how you want it to be.
Harsh Kumar: Fantastic. And for my follow-up, I know investors always look forward and kind of want you to deliver on the next thing. So the question on 8-inch wafers. We hear a lot from investors about the cost disruption that, that might bring supposedly lower costs. Curious, if your customers bring this up with you at all at this point in time, and then I know you have plans for 8-inch wafer. Maybe you could update us on those while you're at it. And then Hassane, I also had a clarification on your previous question. Are you shooting for more than 50% internal by the end of the year for silicon carbide or the vast majority.
Hassane El-Khoury: Okay. The latter one, we are expecting over 50% by the end of the year, but that's not what the goal is. The goal is above that and we'll reach that in 2024. So we're going to exit above 50% this year and we're going to keep going into 2024 and we'll update you on kind of where we see that depending on the market and the dynamic there. The first part of the question...
Harsh Kumar: 8-inch.
Hassane El-Khoury: So we’ve -- we're still consistent and on track with what I've described in the past. We are running 8-inch currently. We are running it for what we -- what I call building the baseline, baseline yield, baseline all of that. So we're -- we have been producing 8-inch wafers in order to kind of flush out all of the manufacturing. So when we go to ramp, we are able to ramp as fast and as successfully as we have done in 6-inch. So our customers don't ask for that. What our customers care for is delivering the cost structure to be competitive, delivering the capacity to be able to ramp and be in there when they need to ramp. We're able to deliver on all of these commitments, both on 6-inch today and 8-inch moving forward. Our customers looked and audited our manufacturing capabilities on site. They feel as comfortable as we are and look, and you see it with, when somebody signs a 10-year LTSA, it's got 8-inch in it. And that's the confidence that they have in our business that we're able to deliver.
Harsh Kumar: Congrats again, guys. Thank you.
Hassane El-Khoury: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo.
Gary Mobley: Hey, guys. Can you hear me?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yeah.
Gary Mobley: We're cutting out here at the end of the introduction, I apologize. I appreciate the fact that you're probably going to increase your silicon carbide revenue for five-fold this year. Then maybe if you can speak to a preliminary view for fiscal year '24 considering supply constraints. It sounds like you're not demand constrained, but maybe focusing primarily on the supply side?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yeah. We're not going to guide for 2024, but you can basically, when we get to Q4, you can take the exit rate, which is going to be healthy and then project forward. But we're not projecting into 2024, it will be substantially higher.
Gary Mobley: Okay. And maybe if you can give us an update on any sort of government subsidies, chipset funding, equivalents, elsewhere, specific to the silicon side of the business. And then as well, so can carbide, I understand the really weren't a CHIPs Act (ph) support for silicon carbide, but I think you had an opportunity to comment on that. Maybe if you can give us an update on where that stands?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yeah. Look, we're engaged in all parties, not just in the U.S., but of course, in Europe and we have a big operation in Korea, which has their own or variant of the CHIPs Act. So we're engaged in all three. We've announced a $2 billion investment for an end-to-end silicon carbide manufacturing, which will be the only one in the world really from substrates all the way to wafers on the same site. And we're considering all three of these regions because we have brownfield capabilities in all three of these regions. We talked about a decision made between now and the end of the year of where it's going to be. And part of the decision is well, the main decision is purely economic and financial. Therefore, the funding from the government plays a big role in swinging it one way or another for depending on which site. We're in the process and the discussions of all of these, but that one is specifically related to silicon carbide to comment on your question. As far as in general, we have made comments on silicon carbide, specifically in the CHIPS Act, but that's really up to them to what they do with it and that's part of our decision-making progress. We're going to go where it makes sense to get the best ROIC for our investments, and that's how we create shareholder value. That remains the top of our priority and we're going to make that decision between now and the year of where it goes.
Gary Mobley: Thanks, Hassane.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.
Christopher Rolland: Hey, guys. Thanks for the question and great quarter. So my question is around your strategy, you’re thinking around co-investment on SEC, some of your competitors are looking for $1 billion almost financing through these commitments. I know you did well with like Vitesco and Magna here for smaller amounts. But I'm really wondering about the strategy here. Are they investing in new capacity? What are they getting out of this? Are they getting a haircut on wafers or is it just dedicated capacity? How are you thinking about this? And the amount you want to take in overall from your customers as well to help finance this?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yeah. Look, I will start at a very high level. One, what differentiate onsemi, we can afford our own investments because of the cash flow from operations. So we're not looking at funding as a way to help us grow the business and help us build capacity. You look at our balance sheet, you look at our cash position and you look at the cash from operations and our CapEx investments, all of them are able to be supported by our operations. So a very different posture when it comes to capacity expansion. Where it comes strategically from a customer is really, it's a win-win. It's the commitment. There is no higher commitment on an LTSA than one where the customer co-invest with us. And that co-investments have multiple scenarios with it, depending on the customer and what problem or what opportunity they look for. So it's not a haircut. It's basically, it's an offset of depreciation. It doesn't change our cost structure for the value that we provide. It just offsets depreciation, whether it's depreciation on our book or their book based on the ownership of the equipment and how we apply that investment. And again, those are strategic in nature, which means everyone is specific to what that specific customer is trying to solve for and we work constructively with all of these customers. But it is not a -- we must get that money for us to ramp. This is a -- we are able to ramp and those are strategic investments. So it's a very different field we're playing in.
Christopher Rolland: Great.
Hassane El-Khoury: And the reason for the delta in dollars that you see is, again, goes back to Brownfield versus Greenfield. We're investing in Brownfield, which Thad at Analyst Day (ph) talked about a 40% better CapEx than a Greenfield. So that gives you kind of the delta why we're able to ramp so quickly much higher in output for much lower cost.
Christopher Rolland: Yeah. We definitely understand the efficiencies there. I also wanted to talk about solar. I wasn't expecting $2 billion in LTSAs from solar, which is, I believe, part of industrial. Are you expecting industrial SiC now to ramp faster? And then just as a follow-on there, just talking about gross margins for SiC overall. You said they doubled first profitable quarter. talk about this progression? Is this all moving faster than you would expect? And is it in part because of these industrial as a percentage of SiC as well? Thank you.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yeah. So on the revenue ramp for industrial, specifically on the energy infrastructure, the $1.95 billion is both silicon and silicon carbide. Remember that market is being serviced by a very unique value proposition we have. Simon talked about in the Analyst Day, the hybrid module, where we're able to put the best technology required into a single module to provide those customers. So that 1.95 is on both power technologies, IGBT or silicon and silicon carbide. As far as the ramp, look, they'll be ramping in tandem together. But the automotive number, given the TAM in automotive, we'll just ramp up to a higher number. But as far as percent ramp, they're both going to be a ramp. And if you recall, last year, we talked about how that business ramps 70% growth for the last two years. So it's pretty healthy growth. But from a dollar, of course, it's going to trail the automotive purely because of the TAM of the market that we're addressing. But both growth, both CAGR are very healthy and will remain healthy over the next five years as we execute those LTSAs.
Thad Trent: Yeah. And on the performance -- the financial performance of the silicon carbide business, look, we're extremely proud of what the team has accomplished there, doubling gross margins quarter-over-quarter. Achieving the first profitable quarter, again, on a fully loaded basis upon. And operating margins in the high-teen percentage is very impressive for the performance there. What I would tell you is, we have line of sight to that. It's ahead of schedule because we are ramping well. And on all metrics, we're ahead of plan. So although, we have line of sight to profitability, we’ve achieved it quicker than what we was in our original plan. So I think as we go forward, we’ll continue to see that expansion. And as revenue grows, that will continue to contribute to the bottom line.
Christopher Rolland: Thanks, Thad. Congrats again, guys.
Thad Trent: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen.
Joshua Buchalter: Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the results. I did want to follow up on the last one. So you mentioned in the prepared remarks, I think it's high-teens operating margin for silicon carbide. Any way to disaggregate the levels internal substrates versus external and should we expect, as you ramp internal substrates over the coming quarters, should that continue to move higher? Because I would imagine, at least initially, it would be -- it could be a headwind to margins. Thank you.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yeah. Look, we're not breaking up as what it is. You can take it as an aggregate totally mix adjusted is what the number is. And it's going to keep going up, of course, as that business absorbs the start-up costs because look, there's still start-up costs in that business. So as we scale that business, start-up costs will be more absorption and that is how we will be continuously improving the gross margin trajectory, which consequently will improve the operating margin. So that financial milestone that we have achieved is not the destination. It's just a milestone. We have always had line of sight to it, like Thad said, we achieved it earlier than we expected, but the ramp or the, call it, the slope of that improvement will just continue from here and we'll continue to improve on all financial metrics as that business scales and as that mix changes.
Joshua Buchalter: Got it. Thanks for the color. I'm going to try to ask a question that involves the other 80% of your business now. East Fishkill headwinds for two quarters in a row have come in higher than anticipated. Can you walk us through just what's going on there? Why are they higher for longer and should we expect it to sort of trough in the beginning part of 2024? Is that the right time frame? Thank you.
Thad Trent: Yeah. I think if you go back to what we disclosed and what we announced last quarter, it's very consistent, right? We got a surprise in the cost structure there. We've now been spending six months really getting our arms around it and understanding what we need to get that cost structure back in line. Look, we've got a large manufacturing footprint, we know how to run fabs efficiently, we’ve benchmarked, we know exactly what we need to do. As I say, this is like locking and tackling of what we need to do to take the cost structure out, but it takes time. It’s hard to take cost out when you running a fab at full capacity. So the time horizon is little bit longer than we expected. It will be from the next several quarters. I think – you think about this has been probably a year maybe slightly more than a year of headwind for us as we continue to take the cost out. But we expect by the time we exit 24 we’ve got that fab at parity and running efficiently.
Hassane El-Khoury: But one thing I would also highlight is, yes, the headwinds are higher than we expected. But to use your words, if you look at all the other operational metrics that we've delivered reflected in the reported gross margin and the guide we're able to absorb it and then some, given the beat this quarter and the rates for next quarter. So back to Thad's point, we know how to fix this stuff. We've been fixing it for the last two years. That's just another thing we're going to work on. We have line of sight to just going to take time. But of course, the rest of our business is operating in stellar including the underutilization that we've had to do. So our margin is structurally very different from what it used to be. And that I can say, I’m very, very comfortable, happy and confident about.
Joshua Buchalter: Understood. Appreciate the color. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Quinn Bolton with Needham.
Quinn Bolton: Hi, Hassane and Thad, congratulations on the nice results. Thad, I guess I just wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more color on the gross margin. Revenues trending up, sounds like SiC margins are moving higher. So I'm just wondering, are there any particular headwinds in the third quarter for the 40 basis point decline in gross margin at the midpoint?
Thad Trent: Yeah. Look, so we've got a number of things, right? We just talked about EFK. So clearly, that's a headwind. You've got utilization. Utilization dropped down slightly in Q2 from 71% to 70%. As we look forward, we think about utilization being kind of in that flat to down category. So we may have a little more headwind on that. But the key contributor to that margin stepping down just slightly is the ramp of silicon carbide. So even though the margins have doubled, it's still dilutive to the corporate average. So as revenue increases, you have more of a dilutive impact on Q3. So I would think quarter-over-quarter, really the delta is a little bit more underutilization charge and then this impact of the ramp of silicon carbide.
Quinn Bolton: Great. And just a quick follow-up. Do you expect quarter-to-quarter the SiC margins to improve understanding they're still below corporate average?
Thad Trent: Yeah, absolutely.
Quinn Bolton: Perfect. Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.
Timothy Arcuri: Hi. Thanks. Do you have any update to the $4.5 billion LTSA from 2023 to 2025 and kind of anything to help us think about what silicon carbide could be next year and into '25?
Thad Trent: Yeah. No, we're not giving an update. Our focus right now is obviously, this year, we'll be given an outlook on 2024 as we get for reporting of the fourth quarter, given the run rate and where we are. Of course, we have the number in LTSAs, but we're not talking about it yet. We're not guiding for it. It will be substantially higher than where it is in 2023, given the LTSAs and the ramp. But right now, we're focusing on the execution in the short term.
Timothy Arcuri: Great. And then, Hassane, how do you think about the captive versus external mix? You did say you're going to be more than 50% this year. But when you sort of lay this out longer term, how do you weigh where you want to take that number to longer term, given some of the investments that some others are making particularly in China. Is there like an upper range of where you want to push that 75% or how do you sort of think about balancing that? Thanks.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yeah. Look, there are multiple factors of how we balanced it. Our focus is to be able to support our customers. When we have LTSAs and we look at supply resilience and supply assurance, we have to be able to manage the too. We're not going to be -- we don't want to be 100% internal. I've said that in the past. You can think about it 80%, give or take and that's going to be dependent on, of course, supply assurance, especially, as you can't ignore the geopolitical aspect of it when you say sourcing out of China, right? That is not a supply assurance path as we stand today with the geopolitical environment. So that, of course, has to play a role. And more importantly, it's the cost we have a factory, we have a factory at scale and we have a factory that is performing very, very well. So for us to want to get supply from the outside. It has to make also economic sense compared to what we are able to do internally. So all of these, we always consider that we always look at what the scenario is going to be. But you can think about it as 80%, give or take, depending all of these factors that I mentioned.
Timothy Arcuri: Thank you, Hassane.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Unidentified Participant: Yeah. Thank you. This is Jeremy (ph) on for Tore. I guess a couple of follow-ups on the earlier questions on the co-investments. Can you help us understand what the mechanics of this are, the impact potentially to gross margins, maybe cash flows? Just wondering how the $40 million or the $250 million co-investment can be played out in the financial statements? Thank you.
Thad Trent: Yeah. As we – this is Thad. So as we receive the cash from customers, obviously, that goes on the balance sheet. The way that it gets accounted for is, it gets amortized over the life of the agreement. So if you think about an LTSA that maybe have five to 10 years, you can think about that dollar amount getting amortized over the life as those products are shipped, it actually is recorded through revenue. So actually, it's a bump in, in margin over that time frame. But you can think about the cash coming in, in advance as we make payments going out, hopefully, it's favorable from a cash flow standpoint. That's the intent that we get cash before we make the commitment to the equipment. And again, just as a reminder, all of the capacity that we're bringing on is to support these LTSAs on those committed revenue. So we're not building capacity on the hope that we can fill it. So in these situations, as Hassane mentioned earlier, these customers are co-investing for assurance of supply with us. But the accounting works that actually hits the revenue line over time.
Unidentified Participant: Great. Thank you. And just a quick follow-up to that. Is the -- so this is like a revenue prepayment. It's not any kind of ownership of the equipments and are there any limitations on maybe if it's specific to the equipment, it's not any limitation on use that for other customers?
Thad Trent: Yeah. Every situation is a little bit different. What I just described there is a prepayment rate, if you think about it, a customer deposit. We do have situations where customers will consign product or selling equipment to us and that situation is a little bit different. It's just a lower depreciation off of our books and that sits on their books. But every situation is a little bit different, depending on the customer situation. Obviously, we want as much flexibility as we can have as we develop these things. So we try not to tie up capacity for one customer and have the ability to move our production on any of the lines on any of the locations. So it's designed to have the ultimate flexibility for us.
Unidentified Participant: Great. And one last question, if I could. With the slightly different free cash flow on results this quarter and the high-teens and the capital intensity that seems to be consistent, with your targets outlined at our Analyst Day. Is there any change to that in the very long term in the 2027 targets? Are you seeing anything in terms of higher costs and also maybe in terms of the ability to achieve the head count you need to ramp this capacity? It seems like that's been the problem with some of the other fab ramp-ups that we're seeing around the world? Is this something that is [indiscernible] to you guys at this point? Thank you.
Thad Trent: Yeah. No, I don't think we're -- I mean outside the norm, I don't think we're seeing a labor shortage, right? And part of this is leveraging our brownfield investments and brownfield footprint where we have head count. In terms of the capital intensity, no change to the long-term plan. This is more of a short-term. As I said, the free cash flow will go back to positive for the remainder of this year. So it's really just the timing of getting that equipment in as well as the ramping of our strategic inventory to support our fab transitions and our silicon carbide ramp. But longer-term, our capital intensity targets all remain the same. We think we’ll be in the mid to high-teens for the foreseeable future, but then stepping down over time, as we’ve outlined previously.
Unidentified Participant: Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of William Stein with Truist Securities.
William Stein: Hi. Great. Thank you for taking my question. Congrats on the great results and outlook. Hassane, at the Analyst Day, you discussed your emerging products in digital power control. I think that is likely related to servers that are focused on AI, maybe you can confirm that understanding and also remind us of your targets and traction towards that?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yeah. So obviously, part of that focus on what we call driver and controllers is the server or the cloud infrastructure, which applies definitely to AI, that's the play we have there. But most of it is also targeted towards our primary markets, the auto and industrial. With every switch or call it, silicon or silicon carbide switch, we have the opportunity with the flywheel effect that Sudhir talked about to increase that content. We're on track there. From a technology perspective, we have already some of the products for internal, I guess, performance. And we will be making progress in sampling come early next year, so very fast progress. It's like what you saw us do in silicon carbide. We're going to -- we decided, we're doubling down, we're starting to run, and we're going to start delivering on that. That's going to be the winning formula for this new business also. So stay tuned for more updates as we get into Q4 or Q1 of '24.
William Stein: Great. And then a follow-up, if I can. You've reiterated many of the goals around the ramp of silicon carbide today, but there's one I'm not sure I heard you talk about yet, and that's the margin exiting the year, I think, in the past, you've said it will be neutral to the -- at the enterprise level. Is that ready for an update? Is it possible you could do better than that or any reason you're backing off that goal? Thank you.
Thad Trent: Will, this is Thad. No, our expectation remains the same. As I was saying earlier, Q3 is the highest dilution impact of silicon carbide just because of the ramp and again, the margins being below the corporate average. We believe by the time we exit the year, we’ll have those margins at the corporate average, as we’ve stated previously.
William Stein: Thank you.
Thad Trent: Thank you.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Hassane El-Khoury for closing remarks.
Hassane El-Khoury: Thank you again for joining our call. We plan to continue to put our winning formula to good use with deliberate execution and operational excellence as we continue to navigate the soft market environment. Through it all, we remain committed to delivering value for our shareholders and confident in our long-term outlook of outgrowing the semiconductor market by 3 times through 2027. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
1500,RIVN,2,2023,2023-08-08 21:07:07,"Operator: Good day and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Rivian's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Tim Bei, Vice President of Strategic Financial and Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Tim Bei: Good afternoon and thank you for joining us for Rivian's second quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we begin matters discussed on this call, including comments and responses to questions reflect management's views as of today. We will also be making statements related to our business operations and financial performance that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our SEC filings and today's shareholder letter. During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in our shareholder letter. Just before the call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of our progress over the recent months. I encourage you to read it for additional details around some of the items we'll cover on today's call. With that, I'll turn the call over to RJ, who will begin with a few opening remarks.
RJ Scaringe: Thanks, Tim. Hello everyone and thanks for joining us today. During our call, I will highlight key developments during the second quarter and provide an update on the progress we're making against our core value drivers. Production continues to ramp, which is translating into improved profitability and capital efficiency. We are also driving material cost reductions through commercial and engineering design updates, including the integration of our in-house dual motor into the R1 product line. We remain focused on the customer experience as we expand our physical, digital and mobile footprint and took important steps during the quarter to improve our charging experience. Importantly, prior to getting into the quarter's details, I'd like to thank our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, communities and shareholders for their continued support of our vision. Consistent with our last earnings call, Claire and I will be inviting different leaders to join us each quarter. For this call, I've asked Wassym Bensaid, our Senior Vice President of Software Development to join given the critical role software plays in enabling our business and the ever improving and expanding capabilities and features of our vehicles. During the second quarter, we produced 13,992 vehicles, which represents a 50% increase compared to the first quarter. Importantly, approximately 70% of the R1 units produced during the second quarter were R1S vehicles. This represents the first time R1S quarterly production was higher than R1T production. Our team in Irvine has made strong progress during the first half of the year, maturing the manufacturing process of the R1S to the point where the build efficiency is essentially equal to the R1T. It's also important to note the R1S is more profitable than the R1T. The ramp of our in-house Enduro Motor line remains a key enabler to near-term production performance. Due to our progress during the first half of the year, we are increasing our 2023 production guidance to 52,000 total units. Building on the successful launch of the in-house Enduro Motors for our commercial vans last quarter, we successfully integrated this motor into the dual motor variant of the R1 platform during the second quarter. This is an important milestone from a cost perspective and we'll also be instrumental in expanding the consumer market opportunity for R1 vehicles. We believe the majority of our long-term R1 demand will come from dual-motor variants. These variants have pricing that starts at just over $70,000, extend up to 400 miles of range, reach 0 to 60 mph in as quick as 3.5 seconds, torque to 11,000 pounds and generate over 800 foot pounds of torque and 650 horsepower. We believe the dual-motor variants offer great value while providing high on and off road performance. The technology and clean sheet approach we've taken with the R1 product line has really enabled the uniquely differentiated product, the features, the attributes, the way the vehicle feels so special. And this is the result of thousands and thousands of tradeoffs we're making between different pieces of content, the way we think about design, the way we think about technology integrating with that design. And of course the R1 product line was intended and is our handshake with the world. It's our flagship product. And so as we've now been thinking a lot about how does that brand position that we've created for a product point of view integrate across the mosaic of all the other touch points we have as a company. And then of course into R2 those same, that same mindset and that same ethos is being applied of course in a smaller form factor and a lower price point. And having spent a lot of time with the teams and closely coordinating all these different trade-offs and sort of thinking about how does Rivian manifest at this lower price point with a smaller form factor, I can say we couldn't possibly more be more excited about what's to come with R2 and really looking forward to showing our product in the early part of 2024. It represents in much the same way that R1 rethought a segment, rethought a space, R2 takes that even further and stretches our ideology and our brand ethos really into such a great segment and such a large addressable market. Now on to our second quarter results, which reflect our continued extreme focus on cost efficiency as we accelerate our drive towards profitability. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, delivered vehicles grew by 60%, while gross profit per vehicle improved by about $35,000. We achieved meaningful reductions in both R1 and EDV vehicle unit costs across the key components, including material costs, manufacturing, labor, overhead, and logistics. Maintaining our cost reduction efforts through consistent focus and collaboration across all levels of the company is a core part of the culture we're building. I also want to take this opportunity to highlight some of the progress we're making from our partnership with Amazon. When designing the electric delivery van, we set out to develop a delivery van which offers a step change in safety, innovation, technology and of course, driver comfort. As of early July, there are EDVs in operation across over 800 cities in the United States. In addition, we recently initiated deliveries of EDVs to Amazon in Europe. It was a strong quarter and we remained focused on ramping production, driving cost efficiencies, developing future technologies and creating an amazing customer experience. With that, I'll pass the call to Wassym to discuss our software development strategy.
Wassym Bensaid: Thank you, RJ. It's good to be here to discuss our software capabilities and the progress we are making. The impact of software is pervasive throughout the company. The most obvious and customer facing aspects of our software is what customers see and experience through their in vehicle digital experience, our over the air updates and the Rivian mobile app. Our priority here is to take feedback from our customers and enhance the customer experience, whether that's through dry modes, comfort features, range efficiency or addressing other pain points that customers may experience. Over here I have actually been called the Chief Reddit Officer given my interaction with customers on the Rivian subreddit. Since launching our own platform in the fall of 2021, we have pushed 22 major software updates to our vehicles. These updates have been filled with features such as Birds Eye Camera View, Drive Cam, Snow Mode, Camp Mode, Bed Mode and much more, all designed to enhance our customers experience. Most recently this included the integration of a better route planner, which we expect to meaningfully improve our customers charging and routing experience. This technology will give our customers the ability to plan and compare charging stops along the way. It also provides us data to help with the site selection of our Rivian Adventure fast-charging network. And the road map we have is equally exciting. While I don't want to share too much yet, over the next months you will see us launch a towing mode update including trader profiles, but camera views, adaptive range estimation and doing charge stations discovery and the navigation app. We also plan to launch drone mode, which will provide an immersive camera experience powered by our computer vision and augmented reality technologies. We believe that our software capabilities are a structural differentiator that will only grow in importance as electric vehicles continue to increase in complexity. Our unique capabilities stem from the intentional decisions we made years ago, when we decided to truly take a clean sheet approach to the software stack and electrical hardware in the vehicle. What this means is that we own the software stack and control nearly every single computer in the vehicle. We designed our software stack to scale to multiple hardware architectures, allowing us to rapidly support three product variants with the high level of code reuse across R1T, R1S and EDV. This modular platform approach is also enabling us to prepare a rapid migration to our next gen zonal electrical architecture, which brings increased levels of system integration and will allow us to achieve significant material cost savings thanks to the hardware consolidation. As I mentioned earlier, at Rivian software is foundational. It supports and optimizes functions throughout the company. What I just described was on the consumer facing side of our work. The work my team does behind the scenes is equally important. Our connected software architecture allows us to gather sophisticated data that provide powerful insights, enabling us to improve the reliability and safety of our products and reduce our service costs. It allows our service teams to perform remote diagnostics and assess the issues that customers may be experiencing well in advance. So we can determine when to deploy mobile service vehicles, what parts to bring, and in some cases even fix the issue through over-the-air software. This in-house platform also powers our manufacturing operations in the plant allowing us to have in line diagnostics that automatically detect potential assembly issues as the vehicle moves through the line and allows us to perform exhaustive electrical quality checks on our vehicles. This ultimately saves us time, improves quality, and improves efficiency during the manufacturing process. As a team, we're excited about the work we do and the impact we are having. It's not often that you get the challenge to redefine how an industry views software. We're encouraged by the work we have done and even more excited about what's to come. With that, let me turn the call over to Claire.
Claire McDonough: Thanks Wassym. Second quarter results reflect the strong progress our team delivered against the operating plan we outlined earlier this year. As RJ mentioned, we remain focused on the drivers of long-term value for our business, ramping production, driving cost efficiencies, building future technologies and improving the customer experience. Turning to our second quarter results, we produced 13,992 vehicles and delivered 12,640 vehicles, which was the primary driver of the $1.1 billion of revenue we generated. Total revenue for the quarter included $34 million of proceeds from the sale of regulatory credits. We expect the sale of regulatory credits to increase over time, but to vary quarter to quarter. During the second quarter, we improved our gross profit per vehicle by approximately $35,000 as compared to the first quarter of 2023, representing a growth margin improvement of over 4400 basis points. The primary drivers include fixed cost leverage, the change in LCNRV inventory write downs and losses on firm purchase commitments, material cost reduction and increased revenue per vehicle delivered. Now going deeper into the material cost reduction drivers, after a full quarter of EDV production with the introduction of the LFP battery pack and our in-house Enduro Drive unit, we are now seeing a 35% reduction in material costs for our vans as compared to Q4 2022. Concurrently, we've seen and continue to see strong progress on our R1 material cost reduction through commercial cost down efforts and a reduction in short-term premiums. Total gross profit for the quarter was negative $412 million as compared to negative $704 million in the same period last year. Total operating expenses in the second quarter of 2023 fell to $873 million as compared to $1 billion in the same period last year. The primary driver of the reduction in operating expenses was related to lower levels of stock based compensation expense. We continue to rationalize our operating expenses despite significant investments in core in-vehicle technologies and the customer experience. Over the past year, we've expanded our physical and mobile service offerings, increased our demo drive capacity, developed and launched a new motor platform, expanded our Rivian Adventure network, built a parts distribution center and remanufacturing center and so much more. All of this was done while lowering our quarterly operating expenses by $131 million of which $89 million consisted of cash expenses. These are all forward investments that position us to capitalize on our direct-to-customer relationship and enable us to scale efficiently as our car park grows. Our gross profit improvements coupled with our operating expense rationalization resulted in $424 million of improvement in adjusted EBITDA as compared to the prior year. We ended the second quarter of 2023 with $10.2 billion in cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. We continue to believe that our cash can fund operations through 2025 and with the addition of our $1.5 billion green convertible notes and the amendment and extension of our $1.5 billion asset base lending agreement earlier this year, we have strengthened our balance sheet as we approach the launch of R2 in 2026. Turning to our business outlook for 2023, we remain focused on ramping production and driving greater cost efficiency across the company. Based on the progress of our production ramp, including the ramp of our in-house motor, along with the latest understanding of the supply chain, we are increasing our production guidance to 52,000 total units. We have also seen strong progress in our cost down efforts and are improving our Adjusted EBITDA guidance to negative $4.2 billion dollars. Finally, we are reducing our capital expenditure guidance for 2023 to $1.7 billion due to a shift in capital expenditure timing. We continue to believe the average capital expenditures per year between this year and next year will be in the low $2 billion area. In closing, we have seen progress in all three aspects of our path to generate positive gross margin, ramping productions, driving material costs down and increasing average selling price. The substantial reductions in EDV material costs driven by the introduction of the LFP Pack and Enduro Drive unit is reflective of the material cost improvements we expect to experience with our R1 platform following the 2024 shutdown to reroute the R1 line to 85,000 units per year and introduce new technologies. This reinforces our confidence in our long term financial targets. We see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high teens adjusted EBITDA margin target and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target. With that, let me turn the call back to the operator to open the line for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Barclays. Your line is now open.
Dan Levy: Hi, good evening and thank you for taking the question. I wanted to dig in first on the gross margin improvement and I realize you said that you're making progress on each of the areas that you flagged in terms of improved fixed cost absorption and material cost reduction. But maybe you can give us a little bit of a voice over, a little bit deeper color on how this is playing out? How much more ground is there in terms of renegotiating some of your supplier contracts? How much more upside is there on the pricing front? And any color on the path to being a contribution margin positive, which is a step in ultimately getting to total gross margin positive?
RJ Scaringe: Thanks, Dan. Yes, this is a major, major focus for us as a business and something that across all aspects of product development or quality teams, our manufacturing teams we're working towards. And as we look at unpacking is your question sort of dug into the gross margin improvements, a portion of it absolutely is the fixed cost absorption improvements that just are born out of the increased volume. But I'm glad you point out a really important element of this is also material cost improvements, so reductions in our bill of materials. And this is -- what we're seeing today is some of, but not all of the improvements that are coming. And as Claire said in her opening remarks, we've achieved roughly 35% reduction in material costs on the EDV program in conjunction with the shutdown that happened at the beginning of this year and we expect a similar level of reductions on R1 with the shutdown that's going to be coming next year. But preceding that there's a whole host of ongoing commercial negotiations, some of which were already beginning to feel and see on R1 and many of which are going to be coming. And I want to just call out a few of the points that I also made in my opening comments. A lot of the improvements in engineering that are going into the vehicle are to drive cost out. So one of the biggest areas is the improvements we're making to the network architecture and consolidating a number of our ECUs into a smaller number of ECUs, ultimately a 60% reduction in the number of ECUs in the vehicle and along with that roughly 25% reduction in the wiring harness length in the vehicle. And so when we look at, you know, when we talk about the confidence we have around further reductions in cost this is not confidence out of thin air. This is confidence that ties to contractual obligations associated with these component changes as well as contractual obligations with our suppliers built into commercial negotiations. And we'll continue to see significant improvements quarter-over-quarter in the cost structure to build our vehicles ultimately laddering up to the margin targets we talked about, the 25% gross margin target for our normal facility, for our normal vehicles produced in our own plant. And Claire, do you want to maybe just talk a little bit about some of the other aspects here around contribution?
Claire McDonough: Sure. On a contribution margin basis, given the significant impact to our material costs on the EDV, the EDVs that we're producing today are contribution margin positive, and then as we think about the R1, the R1 will be contribution margin positive by the end of this year as you heard from RJ through continued progress on supplier contract negotiations as well as some of the upside to price as we introduce the max pack variant later this year.
Dan Levy: Thank you. That's very helpful. And then just as a follow up, I think, one of the broader themes in the EV sales landscape today is just around demand and I think, there's questions broadly around some weakness of demand. Maybe you can give us a sense, I know you've taken away the order backlog, but what confidence do you have that you are -- that your backlog will sustain well into 2024 and that you're going to be supply constrained for the foreseeable future?
RJ Scaringe: One of the things we're perhaps most excited about is just how well received the products have been, and the level of excitement we see from our customers and the folks that are driving our vehicles and we see that manifesting in JD Power awarding us the highest level of customer satisfaction within the EV space, within the premium EV space. But importantly, we see it through the day-to-day interactions we have with the owners of our vehicles, and they become the biggest advocates and essentially marketers, if you will, for our brand and what we're building. With that said we feel very confident in the continued backlog that we have we have clear visibility into deep, into 2024 with that backlog, that's established. And as more and more vehicles are on the roads and, we now have tens of thousands of R1s on the roads, it continues to feed the flywheel of awareness about the brand. And as I said some of our strongest advocates are people that are driving our vehicles every day. And so we we're quite bullish on the continued strong demand we have for our products.
Dan Levy: Great, thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And the next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.
Adam Jonas: Hey, thanks everybody. My first question is on Tesla charging. As we know, there's a kind of a two-way flow here where there's power, there's electrons going into the car, but then data coming out of the car to Tesla. So I'm curious, what data are you required to share or planning to share with Tesla as you join their charging network? Then I have a follow up.
RJ Scaringe: Adam, thanks for the question. Yes, this is a, I think an exciting development just around the relationship that we've put together with Tesla, along with other manufacturers to utilize the North American Charging Standard event as a part of that access their charging network. And we continue to build out our Rivian Adventure Network and that will also have North American Charging Standard adapters or plugs I should say, on it. And that allows us, with our network to access a very large car park with the existing Tesla car park that's out there, which gives us much clearer visibility to profitability of our charging network as well. But in terms of, specifically what occurs in terms of data transfer, there's not any data transfer built into the relationship. So it's a charging relationship whereby our customers will access the network and ultimately pay for the charging, and that will flow from us through to Tesla.
Adam Jonas: Okay. Thanks for confirming that. And just to follow up on your ADAS strategy, you have Mobileye today, but we understand you'll be adding your own camera based ADAS systems side by side with Mobileye on the same windshield. I'm just wondering how long you plan on having these two redundant systems together before you substitute out Mobileye and rely on your own in-house system? Thanks.
RJ Scaringe: Yes. As we think about some of the key differentiating elements of what we're building, of course Wassym spoke about our electronic stack and building our own network architecture and designing and developing all the core to use in the vehicle which is what facilitates and enables this significant reduction in number of ECUs in the vehicle that will be coming into play next year. In much the same way, we also deeply believe that controlling the sensor set the perception stack across the vehicle and allowing that to feed into our autonomy compute module, what that gives us is the ability to have really early fusion of information, meaning we can cross leverage information across multiple cameras, our radar set and in the future additional sensors as well to put us in the best position to have high quality perception information that feeds into our control algorithms. So with that as a, I guess, bit of a technical background on it, that's the reason we've taken the view of owning the hardware stack and the software stack around our self-driving platform is going to put us in a position to create long-term the lowest cost system with early sensor fusion, and therefore the highest level of confidence from the perception stack feeding into the, feeding into the control control system.
Adam Jonas: Okay. Thanks RJ.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. And next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is now open.
John Murphy: Good evening, guys. I just, RJ I just wanted to follow up in particularly, because we have Wassym on the line as well, on that comment you just made, when we think about that Nextgen architecture, I can understand kind of what you're, what you just talked about. Is there anything else from the software side or the functionality of the vehicle from the powertrain side or the HMI side that this Nextgen architecture allows you to do that you might not be able to do right now, and it might put you, out in front in the lead versus other vehicles?
RJ Scaringe: Oh, sure. Well, thanks John. This is something we're super excited about. It's actually the reason we had Wassym join the call today so we could provide some additional color and commentary on the importance of software and how this is such a core aspect of our organization and built into every aspect of how we think about our vehicle platforms and architectures. Just to comment on, and I'll pass it to Wassym for some additional comments, broadly if we wind the clock back many years, we took the decision to develop all the ECUs across the vehicle and so that's, typically these are ECUs would be coming from Tier 1 suppliers, and those ECUs typically when they come from Tier 1 suppliers, they're sort of embodied in that ECU is a set of functions and therefore of course a set of software applications and that mosaic in a traditional world, that mosaic of third party, Tier 1 sourced ECUs has to work together. And it's a very cumbersome network architecture to work with and makes things like over the updates very, very difficult because coordinate, you have to coordinate across multiple different companies on a software platform and software stack that, you as the manufacturer would know. And so we felt very, very strongly that this is something that had to be cord us as a business. We built deep domain expertise in terms of our electronics development capability of course our software development capability. And that, of course, launched into the R1 product where we own the software stack, we own essentially all the ECUs in the vehicle. What that also does, in addition to allowing us to do lots of over the updates, and as you heard Wassym mentioned earlier, since the launch, we've had 22 major over the year updates, beyond that it allows us to look at cost optimization in a really unique way because a specific controller is not tied to a specific sourcing relationship or to a specific set of functions, but rather we control the controller and we control what's on it. So over time, we're consolidating the number of computers we have in the car to be significantly reduced. And next year that first step of that is a 60% reduction in the number of computers in the car relative today. Now that doesn't necessarily directly create customer features. Of course, it takes cost out of the vehicle, allows us to operate with, we think, a significant multi-thousand dollar structural cost advantage relative to the traditional approach. But importantly, it also opens up opportunities to do some really amazing features where you can cross leverage compute, you can cross leverage perception as I referred to with Adam's question. But Wassym, maybe if you can talk just a little bit about this, I know you said in your comments we don't want to give away too much, but we, until late last night, Wassym and I were reviewing some of our software roadmap, and I'm so excited for the world to see the things that we have coming soon, Wassym maybe you can talk a bit about that.
Wassym Bensaid: Yes, absolutely. I think really the core strength that we have is, we own every single computer on the vehicle. So we're able to not only update the infotainment or the connectivity, but we can update the vehicle controls, we can update the vehicle dynamics, the energy management, ADAS, the way the vehicle drives, the way the vehicle navigates, communicates with the entire world. We're able to create end-to-end unique experiences that really redefine the ownership with our customers and really create that regular connection with our community of customers. So we have those capabilities to continue enhancing the feature set. Through that complex integration, we're also able to leverage on those skills, so that we can virtually distribute all these different software features into more constrained hardware platforms in the future, which will bring significant cost down and significant bill of material savings for us for the next generation. I think the last item that I really want to highlight and this is usually not very obvious. I think it's really the role of software behind the scenes. It's the entire connected data infrastructure that we have created where we not only collect data to help with product improvements, reliability improvements, safety improvements, but we're also able to help with reducing the service costs for the company. We're also helping with the acceleration of the overall manufacturing ramp. We're also able to help with the improvement from a quality standpoint for our manufacturing.
John Murphy: Yes. That's very helpful. Can I just ask one last one just on the R1S was it 70% of the R1 mix in the quarter? Yes. I'm just curious how we should think about mix on the R1s going forward. Is the R1s going to continue to take a greater portion of the mix as that's ramping up further and further or is this the kind of level set mix we should think about going forward?
RJ Scaringe: Yes, John, it's a great question. We commented on before up through the first quarter of this year we'd been producing in any given quarter, majority of vehicles were produced were R1T and the second quarter, this past quarter was the first time that R1S represented a majority of what we're producing. And so, for the next quarter or two, we'll be producing greater than, 70% plus of R1S to help address some of the really long backlog. And this is by far and away one of the biggest customer complaints we have, which is the amount of wait time associated with getting a Rivian today. So to bias a little bit towards addressing some of that, that very long painful backlog for R1S, but then with that steady state long-term settling into about 70% R1S production with the remaining 30% being R1T.
John Murphy: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Rod Lache: Sorry, I was on mute. Can you hear me now?
RJ Scaringe: We can, Rod.
Rod Lache: Okay. Sorry about that. Was hoping that you can give us a sense first of all on the bomb and advantage that you see from being able to acquire components with your own silicon and software? Presumably most of your peers are still buying, steering systems and braking systems, and ADAS systems and suppliers are generating some additional revenue for the, the engineering and software that they are adding. Is there a way to maybe talk about what this actually will ultimately mean for an R1 and R2 in terms of dollars per vehicle and when you'll be sort of a more competitive than in terms of cost?
RJ Scaringe: Yes, this is a great questions. It's a bit hard to speak to from an apples-to-apples point of view. But what I'd like to do, just maybe look at two aspects of this. The first is, as you said, removing the Tier 1 as an aggregator of features onto an ECU, what you might often hear called a domain controller that removes that, that margin stacking effect. But importantly it allows us to optimize the way we design the hardware around what we're delivering from a feature set point of view. Meaning we're not taking a piece of hardware that's been developed for a broad application across many to many different vehicles. Take like a body controller or a powertrain control module. So the first is just the optimization that occurs simply by it being specifically designed for us. But the second, and that, I've spoken to this a couple times here that I think is really, really important and very hard to do, if you don't control the hardware in its entirety, is the ability to consolidate what are typically separate ECUs that are tied to specific function sets. And to be able to consolidate those ECUs into single computers that are really tying to a zone of the vehicle, like let's say a front zone of the vehicle a middle zone of the vehicle, a rear zone of the vehicle. And that massive reduction in number of computers in the vehicle not only simplifies not only reduces the number of modules, but also simplifies the wiring harness and the electrical architecture in the vehicle. And so this is an area for us that's been a core focus. And ultimately we're talking about thousands of dollars in savings per vehicle. And to be able to build an architecture that has as few of computers as small number of computers as possible, as simplified of a wiring harness as possible becomes a massive enabler for cost down. And we're going to see that first in R1 next year with some of the changes I talked about already. But importantly, this forms the basis of what will be going into R2. And, R2 from a cost point of view has very aggressive targets, above and beyond just what we're putting in place with the electrical architecture and the compute stack that's in the vehicle, but also, well into other aspects of body design, which will leverage the opportunities afforded to it through the simplification of electronics and network architecture.
Rod Lache: Okay. Thanks for that. Was hoping you can just separately talk about any progress that you've made in your discussions with Amazon regarding the exclusivity deal and just thoughts on the outlook for demand for the EDV and, whether some resolution of that is required in order to achieve the, the target of positive gross profit next year.
RJ Scaringe: Sure. So we continue to have a great relationship with Amazon. It's a great partnership. I think one of the things that I'd want to call out is just the complexities of scaling a logistics network or I should say, taking a scaled logistics network and converting it to electric. As I said, my opening comments we're now, we now have EDVs operating in over 800 cities across the United States. We've recently entered Europe with the product. And the feedback we're getting from drivers has been incredible. You can find this sort of all over the web and certainly no shortage of YouTube clips around just the, I'd say the level of excitement and how, the drivers recognizing the amount of driver focus that went into the design of all the, the touch points, the ingress, egress, the UI, so we're really pleased with that. Now with that said, as we work closely with Amazon to expand how many of those vehicles are getting out, and of course that ties to how rapidly we ramp the production of the EDV product. We're also in, and I've talked about this before, actively working with Amazon to allow us to sell vehicles outside of Amazon sooner than what was originally contemplated in our contract. And so that work remains ongoing. We're very optimistic on that work. Again, the close partnership and of course, Amazon's large position in Rivian helps align incentives to have us solve this year very shortly.
Claire McDonough: And Rod, addressing your second part of the question on impact to gross profit positive in 2024 we hadn't contemplated any external sales beyond Amazon from a commercial standpoint in the, the comments that we've historically made.
Rod Lache: Okay. Just, just to clarify, are you contemplating Amazon at its current run rate or is that a major factor at all in the positive gross profit target?
Claire McDonough: The way I would characterize it is, as we've talked about in the past, Q4 is always a seasonally low volume quarter for Amazon and so that is also been reflected in our gross margin commentary given the Q4, bridge that we've spoken about in the past.
Rod Lache: Okay. All right. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question, please. Our next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.
George Gianarikas: Hi, good afternoon and thanks for taking my questions. Maybe first to focus on your pricing strategy, I know you mentioned earlier that the demand landscape is incredibly strong, but I'm curious as to whether you have thoughts on what's happening with some of your competition in the marketplace and whether you feel comfortable with current prices, your vehicles.
RJ Scaringe: Thanks, George. We've we take a very methodical and thoughtful approach to how we look at our vehicle pricing and, if we look at between the R1T and the R1S each of those products when we think about a price, there's actually a band of pricing that they operate across, and that band is enabled or unlocked, if you will by the introduction of additional variance. So the first step in that is introducing the dual motor into the vehicles. As you heard in my opening comments, the dual motor as our “base powertrain” is a really exciting configuration. It's still capable of zero to 60 and three and a half seconds towing of 11,000 pounds. It's really an enjoyable architecture. And as a base configuration, it's outstanding. And of course, it doesn't have the same off-road capabilities necessarily as the quad motor, but we think for a majority of use cases, it's really a perfect fit. So that's the first step in providing customers with a lower price variant of either R1T or R1S. And then the next step, which is coming here shortly, is the introduction of our standard pack. And the standard pack not only is a lower cost pack for us to build, but importantly allows customers skin to an R1 vehicle just over $70,000. And so as we think about the positioning of the product, the capabilities of the product with on-road, off-road dynamically the feature set that's in the vehicles, we feel quite comfortable with the positioning of what we've done. Now, I'd also want to just comment, there's lots of ways to try to measure demand, and one of the things, we look very closely at is residual value. And residual value is nice because, it gives us a reflect, it sort of reflects, how our used vehicles are trading, which gives us indication of overall demand positioning. And the R1 products within the truck and SUV segment are among the best residual values of any product in those categories, regardless of electric or combustion. So across both combustion vehicles and electric vehicles, our vehicles are maintaining value extremely well. And even so far as a brand, typically you buy a brand new car the moment you “transact on a vehicle”, you lose roughly 10% to 15% of its value. People often say you drive an awful lot and it loses value in our case, once the transaction occurs, the vehicle value doesn't really drop. They're maintaining really well. And of course that's just an artifact of the strong demand backdrop that we have and the willingness to pay for the products we're building.
George Gianarikas: Thank you. And maybe as a follow up, you spent a lot of time in the release discussing vertical integration, maybe relative to your initial plans, a couple, few years ago, the speed at which you vertically integrate maybe has have been a little bit slower. So I'm curious if there is one key component of your business that you could insource today in a world of infinite capital, theoretically, what would it be? Thank you.
RJ Scaringe: The -- we spoke about this a bunch on the call today. The area that I would say, we've -- from the very beginning, we knew we wanted to completely control and we do completely control Very good about this is investing in the software and electronics capabilities within the vehicle. So I would say that's among the most important things to own in looking at what is a structurally cost-advantaged vehicle manufacturer look like in the world of today. We've recently vertically integrated our drive unit, and that's with the Enduro drive unit at the single motor per axle. And Claire commented on this before, but that is creating very meaningful cost advantages relative to what we launched with. And just as a reminder, what we launched with, we did the inverter in-house the gearbox in-house, the assemblage in-house, we purchased the rotor and stator from a supplier. On our dual-motor setup, that's now coming house, and that's the strategy we'll continue to pursue with the propulsion platform, and we're working very hard to continue to advance that given the cost efficiencies and cost advantages that clearly is driving in the business.
George Gianarikas: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. Our next comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon and thank you very much for taking my question. I was hoping to better understand the financial outlook and the updated EBITDA guidance for 2023. I believe it implies a slightly larger EBITDA loss in the second half of this year relative to the first. So I was hoping to better understand what the drivers of that may be.
Claire McDonough: Mark, what are the key drivers embedded within that second half guidance is a more conservative outlook around the magnitude of tailwinds that we ascribed to the unwind or reduction in our LCNRV charges on a go-forward basis. And so that's a little bit of color as you think about the fact, excluding LTV, we expect to make significant progress against our improved gross margins as we track throughout the second half of the year. We began to introduce the Enduro drive units that RJ just spoke about into the R1 vehicles that will be a material cost reduction There the continued progress from a commercial cost vantage point as well as some of the increases that we'll continue to see as we ramp up production in the course of Q3. and importantly as well, drive towards higher average selling prices through the introduction of our dual Max pack in the end of this year as well.
Mark Delaney: Thanks for that Claire. And then my other question was just on the opportunity for sell products beyond the vehicle. I mean you spoke a bit already around software -- but I think there's other services and accessories that are an important part of the long-term opportunity for Rivian in terms of profitability, so things like insurance and selling some of the gear and camping accessories curious if you could share an update around where the company stands on providing some of those products? Thanks.
RJ Scaringe: Thanks, Mark. When we think about the overall revenue opportunities we have as a business. Of course, the obvious place for us to all sort of our minds to go to is the vehicle. But there's a whole ecosystem of products and services that surround the vehicle that we think represents significant opportunities, both in terms of alleviating customer pain points, but also in terms of creating really exciting and sort of joyful customer experiences. And so that starts with the purchase process and simplifying what a digital transaction looks like, which we've done through our platforms, we continue to push ourselves hard to improve that further that then immediately connects into the insurance platform. We've not announced any of this specifics on the returns for our insurance platform, but it's a profitable part of our business, and it's -- the attach rate on this is quite high. So we're very bullish on the long-term potential of our insurance offering. And then as you called out, what we think of as our adventure product? So the year that goes with the vehicle, this is a huge opportunity and something that, particularly as we look at the R2 product line, there's really exciting intentionally thought out opportunities that sort of as the vehicles are being architected, we're putting some of these really fun personalization items into this contemplated adventure products offering where it also moves cost out of the core vehicle and into the accessories, which allows us to achieve a baseline vehicle with very aggressive cost structure. And then last but certainly not least is the role that software complaints. So there's a host of ways this has been talked about and looked at. I think often, this is sometimes oversold. I'd say, in the space where we sort of imagine these very, very large revenue numbers or companies often imagine these, I want to call out that we believe table stakes are going to be -- is going to require a very robust, very thorough software platform but it still provides opportunities for very specific, unique, highly differentiated, highly complex features to be sold as an additional service or subscription. And we've seen this play out in the autonomy space, but we see and where we certainly have plans for ourselves, but there's a host of other areas. And Wassym, if you can just talk about this for a moment because this is something I know you and I spend a lot of time on.
Wassym Bensaid: Thanks, RJ. I mean, first of all, we are developing and expanding software and services for our commercial business. Every EDV that we sell today comes with a subscription for [indiscernible]. We continue to enhance the road map and add more features and more services to it. On the consumer side, as RJ mentioned, we are being really extremely thoughtful about which features could become paid options. We believe that there is an opportunity in a specific subset of features. Those features need to meet certain criteria. It has -- this is the future that require a very high level of complexity from a development standpoint or features, which require high compute, whether it's in the vehicle or in the cloud. We have internally road map that we will communicate as we basically build it with our customers.
Mark Delaney: Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. One moment for our next question please. Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Emmanuel Rosner: Thank you very much. So it sounds like the factory rerates planned for next year is a very important step in towards reaching your goals. Can you maybe just help us understand again the timing of it? And importantly, what sort of available capacity you would leave you with on the other side of it, but also effective capacity for 2024 as a whole?
RJ Scaringe: Yes. Thanks, Emmanuel. The updates we're making to the line next year, I'm glad you asked the question what you did. They have really two core purposes. The first is, as you called out, it's a capacity increase for the R1 line, where we effectively grow the capacity of R1 from 65,000 units on an annual basis to 85,000 units. But I'd say more importantly in the area that we believe we're going to have certainly, there will be lots of interest in over the next few quarters is what that represents in terms of a step change in our cost structure. And we integrate with that shutdown, a host of product level improvements that simplify the vehicle and remove considerable costs consistent with what Claire and I both spoke about before that we saw with – associated with the shutdown in EV. Now that's not to say, and I want to be very clear. It's not going to say cost improvements aren't happening, leading up to that. We have a very clear road map with contractually set up agreements with our suppliers. Some of those being commercial, some of those being technical changes preceding this batch, if you will, of changes – coordinated changes that are happening with the shutdown. Now in terms of the timing of shutdown that will be happening mid next year, we are doing everything we possibly can to minimize the amount of time we need to have the line down to make those changes and improvements. But it will have an impact as a result of the line being down on the R1 output during that time frame. And our – we haven't provided guidance in terms of 2024 production volume. Yet, but certainly, that will play into ultimately the guidance we do provide.
Emmanuel Rosner: Okay. That's very helpful. And then let me ask you about your balance sheet. Claire, you made comments in the prepared remarks that you've obviously strengthened it, and you still have $10 million in cash. And it will take you to, I guess, operationally through 2025. How are you thinking about additional needs for capital raise and potential timing of it and the modalities of it? Like is it something that you could -- you would think of doing short -- sooner rather than later or to the extent that you have room until 2025, it will be later on or more opportunistic?
Claire McDonough: Thanks, Emmanuel. As you mentioned, we remain confident in our cash balance and the fact that it can fund our operations through 2025. And as I spoke about in my prepared remarks with the addition of the convertible notes that we raised in our ABL, that further derisks the launch of R2 as we think about the $10.2 billion of cash and equivalents we have on the balance sheet today. But with that said, our priority is to maintain a strong balance sheet. For us, it provides a safeguard during volatile industry conditions and mitigate risk while scaling important growth capital projects such as the investments that we're making into R2 and our facility in Georgia as well. And so with that in mind, we'll continue to evaluate a variety of capital markets available to Rivian across the entirety of the capital structure. And as we've spoken about and exemplified prior actions in the first half of this year, we'll continue to employ a diversified approach as we look to maintain that strong long-term balance sheet position.
Emmanuel Rosner: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. One moment. And the final question will come from the line of Benjamin Kallo with R.W. Baird. Mr. Kallo, your line is now open. Next question, one moment, it comes from the line of Chris Pierce with Needham. Your final question.
Chris Pierce: Can you just talk about the mechanics in the plumbing behind the 1-day sale in the sense that are these new customers or existing reservation holders that are kind of willing to swap out of a current reservation versus waiting for reservation or is this kind of to get flexibility having the vehicle sooner? Or do customers tend to want what they want, and this gives you opportunity to kind of find new customers? I just want to get the sense of how it went, will we see more of them, that type of thing.
RJ Scaringe: Thanks, Chris. I think you're referring to an event we did in Normal and where we had on-site sale.
Chris Pierce: Yes.
RJ Scaringe: Yes, I think this has gotten so much more attention than we ever could have imagined. This was an artifact of us looking at some of the vehicles that are coming off the line and the potential where those vehicles were sort of late on matches where our customer changed order configuration or changed color combination, whatever the case may have been where they were available to be matched locally and essentially provide a on having to shift the vehicles. It was something we did more as an experiment to look at. I would say it's sort of one of many types of experience we run conduct being direct to consumer and having the ability to do things like that.
Chris Pierce: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. At this time, I'd like to hand the conference back over to Mr. R.J. Scaringe for closing remarks, please.
RJ Scaringe: Well, I want to thank everybody for joining today. We're really excited about the progress we're making in and hopefully reflected in collectively in our comments and discussions today. It's clear that our focus very much remains on not only ramp -- continuing to ramp production in our normal production facility, but importantly, driving costs down across the business on our path to profitability. And we see that manifesting in significant progress between Q1 and Q2 and our overall gross margin structure, and we intend to continue to make that type of progress as we approach the long-term target for the Normal facility of 25% gross margins. I'd say the other point I'd want to call out and this, again, evidenced by Wassym joining us here on the call is just the importance that we place on the tactical differentiation of our products and our platform and not only enabling us to run and manage our operations more effectively in terms of over their updates, continued progress or continued features that make a range of vehicles, but importantly, actually simplifying the vehicle architecture because of the control of these core technology stacks around electronics, software and associated network architecture. And that really forms the basis of the foundation, if you will, for what's to come with our R2 platform. And this is so foundational to what we're building in, obviously, takes a lot of work on the front end to build all this capability and both on the hardware side and the software side. But we're going to start to see the benefits of that being realized in the immediate term through the cost savings and the significant improvements we'll see quarter-over-quarter. But importantly, we'll see it when we reveal and show the products for R2 and the level of content and what will be available at the price points we'll be talking about for R2 when we show that product early next year. So with that, thank you, everyone, for joining and look forward to our next call. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."
1843,TSLA,3,2023,2023-10-18 22:06:06,"Elon Musk: [Call Starts Abruptly]…of new factories and we believe there’s still meaningful room for improvement there. Regarding Autopilot and AI, our vehicles are now driven over 0.5 billion miles with FSD beta, full self-driving beta, and that number is growing rapidly. We recently completed a 10,000 GPU cluster of H100s. We think probably bring it into operation faster than anyone’s ever brought that much compute per unit time into production, since training is the fundamental limiting factor on progress with full self-driving and vehicle autonomy. We’re also seeing significant promise with FSD version 12. This is the end-to-end AI where it’s photon count in, controls out. Really you can think of it as there’s just a large bitstream coming in and a tiny bitstream going out, compressing reality into a very small set of outputs, which is actually kind of how humans work. The vast majority of human data input is optics from our eyes. And so, we are like the car, photons in, controls out with neural nets, just neural nets in the middle. So, interesting to think about that. We’ll continue to invest significantly in AI development, as this is really the mass game changer. And I mean success in this regard in the long-term I think has the potential to make Tesla the most valuable company in the world by far. If you have fully autonomous cars at scale and fully autonomous humanoid robots that are truly useful, it’s not clear what the limit is. Regarding energy storage, we deployed 4 gigawatt hours of energy of storage products in Q3. And as this business grows, the energy division is becoming our highest margin business. Energy and service now contribute over $0.5 billion to quarterly profit. The Cybertruck, I know a lot of people are excited about the Cybertruck. I am too. I’ve driven the car. It’s an amazing product. I do want to emphasize that there will be enormous challenges in reaching volume production with the Cybertruck, and then in making a Cybertruck cash flow positive. This is simply normal for when you’ve got a product with a lot of new technology or any new vehicle, brand new vehicle program, but especially one that is as different and advanced as the Cybertruck, you will have problems proportionate to how many new things you’re trying to solve at scale. So, I just want to emphasize that while I think this is potentially our best product ever and I think it is our best product ever, it is going to be -- require immense work to reach volume production and be cash flow positive at a price that people can afford. Often people do not understand what is truly hard. That’s why I say prototypes are easy, production is hard. People think it’s the idea, or you make a prototype, you design a car. And as soon as they’re designing a car, it’s just anyone can do it, it does require taste, it does require effort to design a prototype. But it’s difficult to going from a prototype to volume production, it’s like 10,000% harder to get to volume production than to make a prototype in the first place, and then it is even harder than that to reach positive cash flow. That is why there have not been new car startups that have been successful for a 100 years apart from Tesla. So, I just want to temper expectations for Cybertruck. It’s a great product, but financially it will take, I don’t know, a year to 18 months before it is a significant positive cash flow contributor. I wish there was some way for that to be different, but that’s my best guess. The demand is off the charts. We have over 1 million people who’ve reserved the car. So it’s not a demand issue, but we have to make it and we need to make it at a price that people can afford, insanely difficult things. In conclusion, we continue to focus on ramping production while maintaining positive cash flow and we continue to target -- expect to have around 1.8 million vehicle deliveries, as stated earlier this year. The Tesla AI team is I think one of the world’s best, and I think it is actually by far the world’s best when it comes to real world AI. I’ll say that again, Tesla has the best real world AI team on earth, period, and it’s getting better. And lastly, I wanted to thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times. Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact that you’re making.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much, Elon. And our CFO, Vaibhav, has some opening remarks as well.
Vaibhav Taneja: Thanks, Martin. Vehicle deliveries in Q3 outpaced production, and we had yet another record quarter of profitability in our energy business. Congratulations to the Tesla team for the continued focus on operational excellence as we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, higher interest rates, and shifting consumer sentiment. As Elon mentioned, our Q3 operational and financial performance was impacted by planned downtimes for our factory upgrades. This was necessary to allow for further factory improvements and production rate increases. Despite such factory shutdowns, our cost per vehicle decreased to approximately $37,500. We saw sequential decreases in material cost and freight. Reducing the cost of our vehicles is our top priority. On the operating expenses front, R&D expenses continued to rise due to Cybertruck prototype builds and pilot production testing combined with spend on AI technologies like full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo. We have and will continue to make investments in these areas, and hence our capital expenditure and R&D will continue to grow in the near term. However, our focus is to continue making investments through positive cash flow from operations. This year itself, we have generated operating cash flows of approximately [$8.9 billion] (ph) and free cash flows of approximately $2.3 billion. Our other businesses are becoming more prominent on a standalone basis with energy business leading the charge, primarily from the growth in Megapack deployments. Our services and other businesses on a year-on-year basis also continue to show positive momentum as we benefit from our growing fleet. As regards our pricing strategy, in addition to what we have shared before, I want to elaborate that most car buying happens with one or other form of financing, and hence we also view pricing in terms of monthly costs for the customer. And therefore, as interest costs in the U.S. have risen substantially, it has required us to adjust the price of our vehicles to keep the monthly cost in parity. We’ve tried to offset such adjustments via focus on reducing costs. However, there is an inherent lag in cost reductions, which in turn impacts margins. To that extent, we recently announced a partner vehicle leasing program in the U.S. whereby you can get a standard Model Y for as low as $399 a month. In conclusion, as we navigate through a challenging economic environment, we’re focused on reducing costs, maximizing delivery volumes, and continuing making investments in the future, in particular, AI and other next generation platform. We believe this strategy positions us well for the long term. Once again, I would like to thank the Tesla team for their efforts in the last quarter.
A - Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. And now let’s go to investor questions. The first investor question comes from Craig. How many Cybertruck deliveries do you anticipate for 2024?
Elon Musk: It’s difficult to make an accurate guess at this point. Going back to what I said earlier that the ramp is going to be extremely difficult. And like I said, there’s no way around that. If you try to make -- if we just try to do some copycat vehicle design, of which there are literally 200 models that are slight variations on a theme in the combustion engine world, distinctions without a difference, then it’s really not that hard. But if you want to do something radical and innovative and something really special, like the Cybertruck, it is extremely difficult because there’s nothing to copy. You have to invent not just the car, but the way to make the car. So, the more uncharted the territory, the less predictable the outcome. Now, I can say that -- if you say, well, where will things end up? I think we’ll end up with roughly a 0.25 million Cybertrucks a year, I don’t think we’re going to reach that output rate next year. I think we’ll probably reach it sometime in 2025. That’s my best guess.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The second question is, can you provide a progress update on the 4680 cell, particularly progress towards performance improvements and cost savings outlined on Battery Day? Thank you.
Unidentified Company Representative: Sure thing, Martin. 4680 cell production in Texas increased 40% quarter-over-quarter. Congrats to the Texas team for producing their 20 million cell off of line one. Texas is now our primary 4680 facility. We’re heavily focused on quality. Scrap is down 40% quarter-over-quarter. With the increased volume and yield improvements, cell costs consistently improved month-over-month within the quarter, although we have a lot more work to do to achieve our steady state goals. And that is our priority. The Cybertruck cell with 10% higher energy than our Model Y cell started production on line two in Texas. This quarter we convert to building a 100% Cybertruck cells to simplify and focus the factory as we ramp all four lines in Phase 1 over the next three quarters. Phase 2 of the Texas 4680 facility is currently under construction. The additional four lines incorporate further capital efficiencies over Phase 1, and our target is for them to start producing in late 2024. Lastly, in Kato, we’re retooling to enable large scale pallet runs of our next generation cell designs. Kato’s long-term goal is to be the launch pad for new cells, one generation ahead of our mass production facilities, enabling faster iteration and smoother ramp ups of new designs.
A – Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question from institutional investors. Could you please provide an update on capacity expansion plans for company’s factories in Berlin and Austin, and the opening schedule of Gigafactory Mexico?
A – Unidentified Company Representative: Berlin and Austin factories, the current priority is actually maximize the output from our existing lines, by laser focus on efficiency improvement. As always, maintaining a high quality and the reducing per unit cost will be as critical as growing the production volume. For Mexico, we’re working on infrastructure and factory design in parallel with the engineering and development of the new production that we’ll be manufacturing there. That’s what I can share for now.
Elon Musk: In Mexico we’re laying the groundwork to begin construction and doing all the long lead items. But I think we want to just get a sense for what the global economy is like before we go full tilt on the Mexico factory. I’m worried about the high interest rate environment that we’re in. I just can’t emphasize this enough that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment. And as interest rates rise, the proportion of that monthly payment that is interest increases naturally. So, if interest rates remain high or if they go even higher, it’s that much harder for people to buy the car, they simply cannot afford it. And we are tracking, I believe at this point for Model Y to be the best selling car on earth, but not just in revenue, but in unit volume. If you compare that to the other vehicles that are number two and number three and whatnot, they cost much less than our car. So, we’re just hitting law of large numbers situations here. I know people want to us advertising, we are advertising. I think there’s something to be gained on the advertising front. I don’t think it’s nothing. But informing people of a car that is great, but they cannot afford doesn’t really help. So that is really the thing that must be solved is to make the car affordable or the average person cannot buy it for any amount of money or they can’t afford it. So, this is big deal.
Martin Viecha: The next question is, when do you expect Model 3 Highland to be available in the U.S.? I just wanted to address that unfortunately we don’t answer product related questions and timings on earnings calls. So let’s go to the next one. Current sell side consensus assumes that Tesla will deliver 2.3 million vehicles in 2024, representing 28% growth versus 2023 guidance. Is this growth rate achievable without any mass market launches in 2024? And when does Tesla expect to return to its 50% long-term CAGR?
Vaibhav Taneja: When we look at 2024, there are a lot of moving pieces. I just talked about what is happening in the macroeconomic environment. So, we’re focused on growing our volumes in a very cost efficient manner and are carefully reviewing all our options, and we’ll be able to provide a much more meaningful update at our next earnings call.
Elon Musk: Yes. I mean, at the risk of stating the obvious, it is not possible to have a compound growth rate of 50% forever, or you will exceed the mass of the known universe. I think we will grow very rapidly, much faster than any other car company on earth by far.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Next question is do you have an approximate timeline in mind for the robotaxi driven or non-driven? What excites you most about how this project is progressing?
Elon Musk: Well, robotaxi is like necessarily non-driven. I guess, I’m very excited about our progress with autonomy, the end-to-end, nothing but nets self-driving software is amazing. It drives me all around Austin with no interventions. So, it’s clearly the right move. So, it’s really pretty amazing. And obviously, that same software and approach will enable Optimus to do useful things and enable Optimus to learn how to do things simply by looking. So extremely exciting in the long term. As I mentioned before, given that economic output is a number of people times productivity, if you no longer have a constraint on people, effectively, you’ve got a humanoid robot that can do as much as you’d like, your economy is wisely infinite or infinite for all intents and purposes. So, I don’t think anyone is going to do it better than Tesla, not by a long shot. Boston Dynamics is impressive, but their robot lacks a brain or like the Wizard of Oz, whatever. Yes, lacks a brain. And then you also need to be able to design the humanoid robot in such a way that it can be mass manufactured. And then at some point, the robots will manufacture the robots. Now obviously, we need to make sure that it’s a good place for humans in that future. We do not create some variance of the terminator outcome. So, we’re going to put a lot of effort into localized control of the humanoid robot. So basically, anyone will be able to shut it off locally, and you can’t change that, even if you put -- like a software update, you can’t change that. It has to be hard-coded.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, why was the price dropped on FSD if it is getting better and robotaxi is expected so soon?
Elon Musk: Well, we just wanted to make it more affordable as more people try it. Yes, I think, over time, the price of FSD will increase proportionate to its value. So we regard the current price as a kind of a temporary low.
Martin Viecha: The next question is again on FSD. Mercedes is accepting legal liability for when its Level 3 autonomous driving system drive pilot is active. Is Tesla planning to accept legal liability for FSD? And if so, when?
Elon Musk: Well, there’s a lot of people that assume we have legal liability judging by the lawsuits. We’re certainly not being let that off the hook on that front, whether we’d like to or wouldn’t like to do.
Unidentified Company Representative: I mean I think it’s important to remember for everyone that Mercedes’ system is limited to roads in Nevada and some certain cities in California, doesn’t work in the snow or the fog. It must have a lead car in plains, only 40 miles per hour. Our system is meant to be holistic and drive in any conditions, so we obviously have a much more capable approach. But with those kind of limitations, it’s really not very useful.
Elon Musk: No, I think some people understand the profundity of the Tesla AI system. It’s very, very few. It’s basically Baby AGI. It has to understand reality in order to drive, Baby AGI.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question on Optimus. Will Optimus be working on Gigafactory lines next year? If so, how many would you guess will be deployed?
Elon Musk: I think at this point, we are not ready to discuss details of the Optimus program, but we will make -- provide periodic updates online. So, as you can see, we’re -- Optimus a year ago could barely walk and now it can do yoga. So, a few years from now, it can probably do ballet.
Martin Viecha: Sounds good. And the last question from investors is Neural net path planning represents a significant advance in capability and safety for FSD. What steps is Tesla taking to make this technology available outside the U.S.?
Elon Musk: Yes. Our approach has been to try to get it -- like the more places we’re trying to make it work, the harder the problem is. So, the reason we don’t do it in all countries simultaneously is that it would take much longer to make it work anywhere at all. So, that’s why it’s currently just North America. And also for most parts of the world, you have to get approval before deploying things, whereas in the U.S., you can deploy things at risk or at least you take liability for what you’re deploying. So, it’s -- most countries require some sort of extensive approval program. So, we only want to go through that extensive approval program when we think it’s kind of ready for prime time in that country. I apologize it’s not in those countries, but we keep plenty of ways to make it better. And it really needs to drive such that it exceeds the -- even unsupervised, significantly exceeds the probability of entry of a human or significantly better, a lower probability of entry than a human by far. I think we’re tracking to that point very quickly. Obviously, in the past, I’ve been overly optimistic about this. The reason I’ve been overly optimistic is that the progress tends to sort of look like a log curve, which is that you have kind of rapid initial improvements that if you were to extrapolate that rapid fairly linear rate of improvement, you get to self-driving quite quickly, but then the rate of improvement curves over logarithmically as such to asymptote. That’s not happened several times. I would characterize our progress in real world AI as a series of stacked log curve. I think that’s also true in other parts of AI, like LLMs and whatnot, a series of stacked log curves. Each log curve is higher than the last one. So if you keep stacking them, keep stacking logs, eventually get to FSD.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let’s now go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Will Stein from Truist.
Will Stein: We learned earlier on the call, it sounds like you don’t think the truck will ramp to significant volume until its third year of production. Should we have a similar anticipation for the ramp of the next-gen platform, or is there any reason that we should be maybe more optimistic or pessimistic about the ramp profile there?
Elon Musk: Yes. I mean, to be clear, it’s not really the third year of production. It’s kind of like the 18th month of production is roughly my guess. So, it’s just that they happen -- it will happen -- is that the -- it starts this year, spans next year and gets to 2025. So technically, there are three calendar years in there, but there’s actually only 18 months, not three years. I would be very disappointed if it took us -- and that would be shocking if it took us three years. But 18 months from initial deliveries to have -- to reach volume and reach prosperity with an immense -- I can’t tell you how much the blood, sweat and tears level required to achieve that is just staggering. I have been through it many times. Then, here we go again.
Will Stein: Similar path for the next-gen platform?
Unidentified Company Representative: I mean, there’s like unique complexity to Cybertruck.
Elon Musk: Yes. I mean Cybertruck is -- yes. I mean, we dug our own grave with Cybertruck. Nobody -- generally, everybody digs a grave better than themselves. And so it is -- Cybertruck’s one of those special products that comes along only once in a long while. And special products that come along once in a long while are just incredibly difficult to bring to market, to reach volume, to be prosperous. It’s fundamental to the nature of the newness. So now the sort of high-volume, low-cost smaller vehicle is actually much more conventional.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes. In terms of like the technologies we’re putting into it, we didn’t have to invent full hard stainless steel or have mega 9,000-ton castings or the largest hot stamping in the world or new [Technical Difficulty] are quite in the same way as the Cybertruck. I think it will be quite a fast ramp. As I was just saying, we’re doing everything possible to simplify that vehicle in order to achieve a units per minute level that is unheard of in the auto industry.
Unidentified Company Representative: I mean, the single location makes it easier to automate. It also makes it lower cost. Yes, that’s intrinsically lower cost.
Elon Musk: Yes. Let’s be clear, it will be cool, but it’s utilitarian. It’s not meant to be -- fill you with magic. It can get you from A to B. It will be still beautiful. But it’s utility.
Unidentified Company Representative: That’s not 14 inches of [indiscernible] suspension.
Elon Musk: Yes. So I mean, the Cybertruck has a lot of bells and whistles.
Martin Viecha: All right. Thank you very much. Let’s go to Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
Pierre Ferragu: I have first like a follow-up question on FSD and pricing and adoption. So, I agree with you that as FSD improves, we should see its value increasing. But I guess, like the ultimate values of FSD, which is to be able to handle like a robotaxi is not going to necessarily interest everybody, and you have a bit of a degraded version that would be like a chauffeur service where the car drives by itself, but you still have to be in the car and around. And then there is like the hands-on -- eyes-on version of the service. And I guess, there should be like much lower cost, lower feature kind of variance of the service that could have a very large penetration on your installed base and more expensive one that would remain at a lower penetration level. So, I’m just wondering if you’re taking that -- and last but not least, like the simplest version of FSD available and are going to work from a technical perspective, probably before like the ultimate robotaxi version can work if ever. And so I’m wondering how you take that into account and how you’re thinking like the financial contribution of FSD over time and whether you could evolve your pricing along that kind of tiers to increase adoption.
Elon Musk: Yes. A fully autonomous vehicle, I think, Pierre, your -- sort of the economics of autonomous vehicle are truly astounding in a positive way. When you look at passenger vehicles today, they only get about 10 to 12 hours of usage per week. That’s -- if you drive 1.5-hour a day on average, that’s roughly 10 hours a week out of 168 hours. And then there’s also you’re going to have parking and insurance. You got to take care of the car. It’s like there’s a lot of overhead. So I mean, yes, it’s like the economics of the system are just insanely positive given that the car -- like all of the cars we’re making and have made for a while, we believe, are capable of full autonomy. So then if you’re able to say increase the utility of that car by a factor of 5, which only means that you’re -- it’s being used for maybe 50 hours a week out of 168, so you still notice -- you’re still assuming -- that still assumes less than 1/3 of the hours of the week is doing something useful. You’ve increased the value of that by 5, but it still costs the same, like you have something -- then we’re a hardware company with software margins.
Martin Viecha: Pierre, do you have a follow-up?
Pierre Ferragu: Yes, I have actually a follow-up on different topic for you that I have if that’s okay. It’s about like your gross margin in the quarter. Could you give us a sense of like in how the gross margin evolved sequentially, how much was the impact of idle cost? How much was like the sequential benefit, I imagine, of production ramping at Berlin and Austin? And then I saw like this massive jump in energy storage, very strong positive surprise. So, if you can give us the background on that and tell us how we should think about that gross margin going forward.
Vaibhav Taneja: Thanks for the question. So, in terms of -- you have few different aspects of your question. So if I just look at from Q3 perspective, obviously, factory idle time had an impact. It did impact by -- and I won’t give you the exact percentage, but it had a decent impact for the quarter. And when you look at the other pieces, which we are trying to do, we did see certain of our other factories ramping up pretty well, right? And they actually contributed pretty well to the margin for this quarter. In fact, one of the factories came pretty close to in terms of per unit cost to where we are for our other established factory, which is Fremont. So that was a positive in the quarter. When it comes to energy margins, Megapack deployment was the key driver there. And that product has done well. I mean, on the cost curve also, we’ve been able to do a lot there. But I do want to caution that Megapack deployments are a bit lumpy. So yes, we had a great quarter this period. But depending upon where we are trying to deploy that product in different markets, you would see periods where there would be downward pressure on deployment because of us trying to get the product to that base way…
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, product in transit. Yes.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you very much. Let’s go to Rod Lache from Wolfe Research.
Rod Lache: Really nice to see the rate of vehicle cost improvement despite the downtime that you took. You’ve taken now about $2,000 out of the average vehicle costs over the past year. Can you give us maybe a sense of the rate of improvement that you see from the changes that you alluded to, the factory changes you alluded to? Is there a way maybe to convey the speed of improvement on your existing product from here? And then related to that, can you share the timing of your next-gen -- the lower-priced product that you talked about earlier this year?
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes. So just in terms of product margins, there are lots of puts and takes when you look at this. There are certain things which we control, and there are certain things which we don’t control. We get -- we expect that we’ll get some benefits from our cost reduction efforts, which are all underway. So on the other hand, we just finished our factory upgrades late in Q3. Some of these factories are still in the early ramp phase in Q4. We’re still not up to where we want those factories to be. So, they will impact in the near term. Plus, like Elon mentioned, we’re going to be ramping Cybertruck, which is going to be another headwind, which we will be dealing with. On top of all that, there’s overall uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment, which even makes it harder to predict precisely as to where we land. But yes, this is something which -- it’s an evolving thing which we’re observing every day and reacting to it on a daily basis.
Unidentified Company Representative: I would just say that on the cost reduction efforts, like we are not -- we are unflagging in our pursuit of additional cost downs for 2024. We do have a good pipeline of them and work on both the engineering side and the factory operations side. And our intention is to like maintain or exceed the trend that you saw, trying as hard as we possibly can.
Rod Lache: The timing of the next-gen product, can you share that?
Elon Musk: Not at this time.
Rod Lache: Okay. And just as a follow-up, obviously, price is also a driver of demand, but that’s obviously not happening in a vacuum. And you mentioned that -- I think you mentioned that at some point during this call that you’re also maybe hitting the law of large numbers on some of your products. Can you just share how you’re thinking about price elasticity just at this point in this macro environment? And any thoughts along those lines?
Elon Musk: I think that there’s very significant price elasticity. I mean, to be totally frank, if our car costs the same as a RAV4, nobody would buy a RAV4 or at least they’re very unlikely to. It’s worth noting that a lot of these incentives, like the tax credit and whatnot, they’re actually very difficult for the average person to access because they -- most people do not have $10,000 or even $7,500, burning a hole in their bank account. A lot of -- a large number of people are living paycheck to paycheck, and with a lot of debt. They’ve got credit card debt, mortgage debt. So, that’s reality for most people. It’s sometimes difficult for people who are high income and I’d say high to be like someone who’s earning over $200,000 a year to understand what life is like for someone who is earning $50,000 or $60,000 or $70,000 a year, which is most people. So like for a lot of people, like this tax credit just -- they can’t front $7,500 for 18 months or even 6 months to get -- for the tax credit, and they actually don’t, in some case, even have that $7,500 in taxes. So, it’s really just the best regard to people is how much money do they have to pay immediately and how much per month. That’s it. I think you stop right there. And our car is still much more expensive than a RAV4 when you look at it that way.
Vaibhav Taneja: Now one other thing which I’ll add, when you look at car buying in general, we’re trying to get to the next set of EV adapters.
Elon Musk: Not an EV adapter. Just who wants a great car.
Vaibhav Taneja: Exactly.
Elon Musk: It’s not -- so now you get things like -- honestly, I would say it’s like -- somewhat correlates with why doesn’t everyone work from home crowd. I’m like -- I mean this is like some real Marie Antoinette vibes from people who say why is there no work from home. Like what about all the people that have to come to the factory and fill the cars or that all people that have to go to the restaurant and make your food and deliver your food. It’s like what are you talking about, you -- I mean, how detached from reality does the work from home crowd have to be? While they take advantage of all those who do -- who cannot work from home. So, I mean, you have to say like why did I sleep in the factory so many times, because it mattered. So I just can’t emphasize again how important cost is. It’s not an optional thing for most people, it is a necessary thing. We have to make our cars more affordable that people can buy it. And I keep harping on this interest thing, but I mean it just raises the cost of the car. I mean, we’re looking an internal analysis, which we think is more or less on track that when you look at the cost -- or the price reductions we’ve made in, say, the Model Y and you compare that to how much people’s monthly payment has risen due to interest rates, the price of the Model Y is almost unchanged.
Vaibhav Taneja: If you factor in the...
Elon Musk: Yes, which is what I’m trying to say. The thing that matters is the monthly -- it’s how much money do they have to put down and do they literally have that in their bank account or their check balance and then what is the monthly payment. And it doesn’t matter how -- if that monthly payment is principal interest or whatever, it’s just a number, and that number has to not cause their bank account to go negative. That’s it. So going from near zero interest rates to kind of the current very high interest rates, the actual monthly payment is basically the same. It’s just a bunch more of it is going to interest. And there are some incremental challenges beyond that, which is the difficulty of getting credit at all has increased. And so, the number of people who simply cannot get credit, period, even if they’ve got a job and everything is solid, the banks are a little gun-shy on handing out credit given that a bunch of them kicked the bucket earlier this year.
Unidentified Company Representative: There’s also just fewer options, even if they planned out credit, there’s fewer banks to go there.
Elon Musk: Digital banks still exist. Well, if your bank does not exist, you have to establish a relationship with a new bank. And so a lot of regional banks are died, and I mean even Credit Suisse, I mean, geez, that was a shocker. A 160-year-old-ish Swiss institution, it doesn’t exist anymore. That’s mind blowing. And I think there’s still quite a few shoes to drop on the bad credit situation. I mean, commercial real estate obviously is in terrible shape. Credit card debt has been rising significantly. The credit card interest rates are usurious. It’s over 20% interest rates, meaning like -- which over time is just it becomes obviously extremely punishing because if somebody’s paying 20% interest on their credit cards, means they cannot pay them off. If you can’t pay them off and you’re still accruing interest of 20%, you’re at best headed to a bad place.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let’s go to next question from George from Canaccord.
George Gianarikas: Just to focus on the cost per vehicle coming down in future quarters as you discussed in your written remarks. I’m curious as to what the levers of that could be. Is it more scale, more factory utilization? Is it material cost reductions? Are there things like gigacasting? I mean, can you just kind of give us some data points to give us confidence if that’s going to come down over time. And if I can sneak one in, please, there are press reports -- and I know how perilous it is to believe some of these. But, they say that you’ve included radar as an option in some Model Ys in China. And I’m just here to ask if that’s true. And if so, why?
Elon Musk: We’ve not included radar. We have radar as -- a Tesla designed radar is an experiment in Model S and X. That’s it. We’ll see whether that experiment is worth it, but there are no plans to integrate radar into 3 and Y. Just as humans drive well, and in fact, an excellent human driver can drive with amazing safety simply with their eyes, the car will far exceed the average human safety just with vision, far, far, far because, I mean, the car is looking at all directions all at once. We don’t have eyes at the back of our head. And the computer never gets tired and never gets distracted, get drunk, hopefully. And so, radar is -- what really matters is how much does it affect the probability of an accident. And in order for the radar to be effective, you have to be able to do radar-only braking -- you have to do actions that are radar-only. Otherwise, you get this disambiguation problem between vision and radar. That’s why we actually turned off the radar in cars historically that we had shipped, all 3 and Y used to have radar, but we turned it off because the radar actually generated more noise than signal. Now the Tesla designed radar is a high-resolution radar that has some potential to be useful, but the jury is still very much out on whether that is in fact the case.
Unidentified Company Representative: On the cost question, I guess, from the vehicle side, like as Drew mentioned earlier, we are always trying to engineer our products to be cheaper to make and more efficient to make. That comes obviously on the engineering side as we come up with new innovations but as well on the supply chain side. With our partners, we work with them to automate some of their lines and move their bottlenecks and their high cost as well. On the logistics side, getting parts to the factory, it’s not like a one thing that -- you have to check cost everywhere and we do it ruthlessly at all times.
Unidentified Company Representative: Operations efficiency. All of the above.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yes. I would say there’s a whole laundry list of things, which we are chasing. We internally call it the cost attack, where we’re literally going line by line and saying how can we make it better. And it’s a grind.
Elon Musk: It’s a grind. It’s like Game of Thrones but pennies. I mean first approximation, if you’ve got a $40,000 car, and roughly 10,000 items in that car, that means each thing, on average, costs $4. So in order to get the cost down, say, by 10%, you have to get $0.40 out of each part on average. It is a game of pennies.
Unidentified Company Representative: We play it.
Elon Musk: Willingly, yes. We’ve done it many, many times. And even something as simple as like a sticker, like there’s too many stickers internally in the car that nobody ever sees. There’s something as simple as a QR code. You may think, well, putting a QR code on a part. Why don’t just put them on there, it’s like, well, are we actually going to use that QR code?
Unidentified Company Representative: That’s a penny.
Elon Musk: Yes, exactly. And then inevitably, sometimes the QR code doesn’t go on properly or you can’t read it properly, and it stops the line.
Unidentified Company Representative: More than a penny.
Elon Musk: Yes, absolutely. So chipping away, with -- I mean it is trying to -- it does feel like digging a tunnel with a spoon at times.
Unidentified Company Representative: Very much escaping prison.
Vaibhav Taneja: On top of it, like we said, we did some factory upgrades, so we expect volume to go up. That would also bring some savings from higher production. But then on the flip side, we’re going to be ramping a new product like Cybertruck, which we talked about. So, yes, so those are the real puts and takes what we are working for.
Elon Musk: Yes. But there’s not like some accidently some brick of gold that we go left in the car, unfortunately. And it’s -- we’re trying to be very rigorous about improving the quality and capability of the car because it’s like any fool can reduce the cost of a car by making it worse and just deleting functionality and capability and that’s how I call this sort of any fool -- like if you want to like lose weight and you’d say, well, I need to lose over 15 pounds right away, well, you could chop your arm off, but then you’re sitting with one arm. You’re still fat. So sort of like yes, you actually have to eat less food and work out. That’s the actual way. It’s not super fun because food is delicious. And personally, I’m not -- I don’t love working out. I wish I did, but I don’t. Unless moving the mouse consists of working out, in which case, I love moving the mouse.
Martin Viecha: All right. Let’s go to Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.
Colin Langan: You said in the commentary that you’re not going full tilt on the plant in Mexico until there are signs that the economy is strong. Can you continue at a 50% CAGR without that plant? And where would that come from? And any color on what you mean sort of not going full tilt? Could that plant get delayed indefinitely, or what are you are kind of talking about?
Elon Musk: No, we’re definitely making the factory in Mexico. We feel very good about that. We put a lot of effort into looking at different locations, and we feel very good about that location, and we are going to build a factory there, and it’s going to be great. The question is really just one of timing. And there’s going to be a broken record on the interest front. It’s just the interest rates have to come down. Like, if interest rates keep rising, you just fundamentally reduce affordability. It is just the same as increasing the price of the car. So I just don’t have visibility into it. If you can tell me what the interest rates are, I can tell you when we should build the factory. We’re going to build it. And I mean think we’ll start the initial phases of construction next year. But I am still somewhat scarred by 2009 when General Motors and Chrysler went bankrupt. While that’s now 14 years ago, it’s -- that is seared into my mind with a branding iron because Tesla was just hanging on by a thread during that entire time and with -- I mean, we closed a financing round in 2008 at 6 p.m. December 24th, Christmas Eve. And if we had not closed that financing round, we would have bounced payroll two days after Christmas. So we actually closed that around the last hour, the last day that it was possible, stressful to say the least, and then barely made it through 2009. So, I’m like -- I want to just -- I don’t want to be going at top speed into uncertainty. A lot of wars going on in the world obviously as well, so -- and we have room here.
Unidentified Company Representative: Like in Giga Texas. You said we still have room in this building. It’s not full with Cybertruck and the line. There’s plenty of growth opportunities still to have inside the building where our team already is.
Elon Musk: We also have 2,000 acres here.
Unidentified Company Representative: There’s also…
Elon Musk: We’re actually only occupying a tiny corner of the land that we have. We could technically do all the scaling, research just here. So, personnel is our biggest challenge and the greater Austin area only has -- generously the greater Austin area only has 2 million people. So people are moving here and they’re willing to move here, but there is somewhat of a housing crisis. They got to live somewhere. So I don’t know. I mean, I’m just curious. Like I just -- I’m not saying things will be bad. I’m just saying they might be. And I think like Tesla is an incredibly capable ship, but we need to make sure like as -- if the macroeconomic conditions are stormy, even if the best ship is still going to have tough times, the weaker ships will sink. We’re not going to sink. But even a great ship in a storm has challenges. Now that storm will apply to everyone, not just to us and not just to auto industry. It will apply to everyone, I think. So apart from necessary sort of staples, like food and stuff. So I just -- I don’t know. If interest rates start coming down, we will accelerate.
Martin Viecha: All right.
Elon Musk: If anybody’s got any guesses on this, I’d love to be less wrong. And I apologize if I’m perhaps more paranoid than I should be because that might also be the case because I am -- I have PTSD from 2009, big time. And in 2017 through 2019 were not a picnic either. That was very tough going. So the auto industry is also somewhat cyclic because people hesitate to buy a new car if there’s uncertainty in the economy. So it’s car companies do very well in good economic times, and they don’t do as well in tough economic times. So, it’s just -- whereas if somebody is selling bread, then I think that people still eat bread. Yes, we need bread. We need food all time. But new car, you don’t have to have...
Vaibhav Taneja: Especially if there are wars going on and then that impacts your sentiment.
Elon Musk: Yes. I mean people are reading about wars all over the world. Buying a new car tends to not be front of mind.
Martin Viecha: All right. Unfortunately, that’s all the time we have today. Thank you very much for all of your good questions, and we’ll see you again in three months. Thank you very much."
2001,TSLA,3,2022,2022-10-19 22:14:04,"Martin Viecha: Good afternoon, everyone and welcome to Tesla’s Third Quarter 2022 Q&A Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations and I am joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q3 results were announced at about 3:00 p.m. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the Q&A session portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?
Elon Musk: Thank you, Martin. So just to do a Q3 recap. Q3 was another record quarter on many levels. We had our industry-leading operating margin reach 17%. And our free cash flow surpassed $3 billion in Q3 and approached $9 billion in the past 12 months. As our factories ramp, we’re looking forward to a record-breaking Q4. So it really, knock on wood, looks like we’ll have an epic end of year. So, Q4 is looking extremely good. On the production ramp, Giga Berlin achieved another milestone of 2,000 cars made in a week with very good quality and is ramping rapidly. Giga Austin or Giga Texas should reach this milestone very soon. And in fact, just yesterday, we extrapolated yesterday’s build rate, it would be 2,000. Our production of 4680 cells has tripled in Q3 compared to the previous quarter. We are finally gaining rapid traction on the 4680 cell. And its output is growing rapidly, and we expect it to start incorporating in cars and having it be a significant portion of our production here in Texas in the coming months. We also have our second generation of manufacturing equipment for 4680 cells in Texas, which continues to show great progress along with our original pilot line in Fremont. The Fremont factory team once again reached record production in Q3. And we intend to keep raising production in Fremont. Regarding Autopilot, at the end of September, we hosted our second AI Day and drove the first prototype of our Optimus robot, released updates on our training computer and high range improvements of full self-driving software. Our vehicles have now driven nearly 60 miles in full self-driving Beta mode, and this number continues to grow exponentially. Our goal with that AI Day was to [post] (ph) recruiting, and we’ve seen a massive influx of world-class artificial intelligence engineer and scientist resume. So, it generated a tremendous amount of interest from some of the best AI researchers in the world. I can’t emphasize the importance of this enough because I think finally it has become clear to the smartest AI technologists in the world that Tesla is among the very best. So, this quarter, we expect to go to a wide release of full self-driving Beta in North America. So, anyone who has ordered a full self-driving Beta -- full self-driving, will have access to the FSD Beta program this year, probably about a month from now. So -- and then obviously, any new -- anyone who buys a car and purchases a full self-driving option, will immediately have that available to them. So, the safety that we’re seeing when the car is in FSD mode is actually significantly greater than the safety we’re seeing when it is not, which is a key threshold for going to a wide Beta. Let’s see, with respect to demand. We’ve got a lot of questions about demand in recent weeks. I can’t emphasize enough, we have excellent demand for Q4, and we expect to sell every car that we make for as far into future as we can see. So, the factories are running at full speed, and we’re delivering every car we make and keeping operating margins strong. We are still a very small percentage of the total vehicles on the road. Of the 2 billion cars and trucks on the road, we only have about 3.5 million. So, we’ve got a long way to go to even reach 1% of the global fleet. Let’s see. Based on many -- what people -- based on many things, but certainly questions I get on Twitter about buybacks. And I think every one of our Board members has gotten questions about buybacks. We’ve debated the buyback idea extensively at the Board level. The Board generally thinks that it makes sense to do a buyback. But we want to work through the right process to do a buyback, but it’s certainly possible for us to do a buyback on the order of $5 billion to $10 billion, even in the downside scenario next year, even -- given if next year is a very difficult year, we still have the ability to do a $5 billion to $10 billion buyback. This is obviously pending Board review and approval. So, it’s likely that we’ll do some meaningful buyback. So, in conclusion, while the market themes revolve around the short term, it’s very important to focus on the long term. I can’t emphasize this enough with investors and I think long-time investors, obviously recognize it with Tesla. You have your sort of local ups and downs, but long-term trend has been extremely good. And several years ago, I said, I think on an earnings call, and I thought it was possible for Tesla to be worth more than Apple, which was then the highest market cap company, I think, in the market. And Apple at that time, I think it was around $700 billion. And I said it required incredible execution, at least some luck, and we did indeed achieve that. Tesla went, in fact, or passed Apple’s market cap at the time. And now, I’m of the opinion that we can far exceed Apple’s current market cap. In fact, I see a potential path for Tesla to be worth more than Apple and Saudi Aramco combined. So, now that doesn’t mean it will happen or that will be easy. In fact, I think it will be very difficult. It will require a lot of work, some very creative new products, manage expansion and always the luck. But for the first time, I am seeing -- I see a way for Tesla to be -- let’s say, roughly twice the value of Saudi Aramco. And I think that’s -- I haven’t quite seen that yet. I mean, this is the first time I’ve seen that potential. So, we have an incredible product portfolio. I think we’ve got the most exciting product portfolio of any company on earth, some of which you’ve heard about, some of which you haven’t. We’re in the final lap for Cybertruck. We’re building a Cybertruck line here at Giga Texas [Indiscernible] and making a lot of progress in the robotaxi platform design. And then, with respect to batteries, we’re moving as fast as possible to have -- to achieve 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production capacity in the United States, vertically integrated, anode-cathode, [Indiscernible] refining, we’re moving at top speed to do that. So I think it’s an incredibly exciting future and really an unprecedented future. None of this would be possible without the incredible team that we have here at Tesla. So, I’d like to give a huge shout-out to all of our factory employees, engineers, executives and the whole Tesla team. You guys rock. You’re the ones making it happen. Thank you. Thank you, everyone.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. And Zach has some opening remarks as well.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. Thanks, Martin. Just to continue on Elon’s theme, I just want to thank and congratulate the Tesla team for achieving record vehicle deliveries, production and storage deployments in the third quarter. On automotive profitability, our GAAP operating margin was 17.2% with automotive gross margin at 27.9%. Operating margin is one of our best yet, with improvements in operating leverage. However, Austin and Berlin ramp costs weighed on our margins, particularly if you compare it to Q1. Removing regulatory credits and Austin and Berlin, our operating margins would have been our strongest yet and auto gross margin would have been nearly 30%. Note that while small and growing, each car we build in Austin and Berlin is contributing positively to profitability. We also continue to experience margin headwinds associated with macroeconomic conditions, as we’ve discussed at length on prior calls. In particular, raw materials, logistics and foreign exchange was a big part of this past quarter. On energy profitability, we achieved our strongest gross profit yet for this business, driven primarily by record volumes of our Megapack and Powerwall products. Our free cash flows were also a record despite an increase in cars in transit at the end of the quarter, which has a negative impact on working capital. Specifically on cars in transit, as noted in our press release on October 2nd, we’ve started to experience limits on outbound logistics capacity which we didn’t anticipate. This issue is particularly present for ships from Shanghai to Europe and local trucking within certain parts of the U.S. and Europe. Our historical operating pattern of batch building by delivery region leads to extreme concentrations of outbound logistics needs in the final weeks of each quarter. Just to put this in perspective, roughly two-thirds of our Q3 deliveries occurred in September and one-third in the final two weeks. As a result, we’ve begun to smooth the regional builds throughout the quarter to reduce our peak needs for outbound logistics. We expect this to simplify our operations, reduce costs and improve the experience of our customers. As we look ahead, our plans show that we’re on track for the 50% annual growth in production this year, although we are tracking supply chain risks which are beyond our control. On the delivery side, we do expect to be just under 50% growth due to an increase in the cars in transit at the end of the year, as noted, just above. This means that, again, you should expect a gap between production and deliveries in Q4, and those cars in transit will be delivered shortly to their customers upon arrival to their destination in Q1. Austin and Berlin ramp costs will continue to weigh on margins, although we expect the impact to be less than what we saw in Q3. And as Elon mentioned, we are continuing to build as many cars as possible while also maintaining strong operating margins. Thank you.
A - Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. And let’s go first to the shareholder questions. The first shareholder question is, given the stringent battery content and assembly requirements for consumer tax credit eligibility under the Inflation Reduction Act, can you speak to Tesla’s ability to meet those thresholds in each of 2023, 2024 and 2025 through your existing and planned supply chain?
Elon Musk: Well, yes, I mean, I think just at a high level, I’d say, we do expect to fully meet the IRA’s requirements. Do you want to add?
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. We view that passing of the Inflation Reduction Act as a significant boost towards accelerating automation, while also scaling the battery supply chain at large in the United States. We expect Treasury to publish detailed guidance by the end of the year. Until such time, it’s difficult to fully determine the eligibility criteria, but we believe Tesla is very well positioned to capture a significant share of that for solar storage and also electric vehicles.
Elon Musk: Yes, like I said, we’re -- like I said earlier, we’re going to go basically pedal to the metal as fast as humanly possible to get to 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of production in the U.S. vertically integrated.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let’s go to the next question. The next question is, what updates can you offer on the backlog and the recent order intake trends, especially outside of the U.S. and especially in China?”
Elon Musk: Well, it’s -- there’s definitely -- China is experiencing adverse of a recession of sorts, which is property market -- simply from a property market mostly. And Europe has recession of sorts driven by energy. The U.S. actually isn’t -- North America is in a pretty good health, although the Fed is raising interest rates more than they should, but I think they’ll eventually realize that and bring back down again. Demand is a little higher than it would otherwise be. But as I said earlier, we are extremely confident of the great Q4, and we anticipate continuing to grow our vehicle production, sales deliveries by -- on average 50% a year as far into the future as we can see.
Martin Viecha: Thank you.
Elon Musk: Actually one caveat, I should say, growing production by 50% every year because deliveries -- we’re trying to smooth out the deliveries and not have this crazy delivery rate at the end of every quarter, so. In fact, we’re just fundamentally running out of -- there weren’t enough boats, there weren’t enough trains, there weren’t enough car carriers to actually support the wave because it got too big. So, whether we like it or not, we actually have to smooth out the delivery of cars intra-quarter because there aren’t just enough transportation objects to move them around.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, do you still expect 50% annualized growth for the foreseeable future? Is this also true specifically for the Chinese domestic market? Do you expect to need to cut vehicle prices or offer incentives in any market to sustain a demand, or has demand remained stable, or is it even rising? There are three questions there.
Elon Musk: Well, like I said, we want to sort of focus on a high level on what we think is possible here. We -- to the best of our knowledge, we believe that Tesla will continue to grow deliveries and revenue production at a 50% or greater compound annual growth rate. It might occasionally be a year that is a little less, and then some years would be maybe a little more or a lot more. In some of our out-year planning, we see potential annual growth rates that are in excess of 50%.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, “Can you tell us more about the product future road map beyond new models and FSD, and especially for interior and powertrain of existing vehicle models?
Elon Musk: Yes. We could, but who wants? Sorry, guys, we can’t like jumping on, on future product announcement.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Committed to continuing...
Elon Musk: Yes, we obviously are -- yes. But we’ll also be committed to continuous growth. Yes. At Tesla, we’ve always been committed to continuous improvement. So, as friends might have asked me like, when should I buy a car, I’m like now because we just keep improving the cars.
Zachary Kirkhorn: There’s always the latest Tesla.
Elon Musk: Yes, there’s still latest Tesla. I don’t really -- yes, the -- every now and again, we do have some big technology upgrade, like Plaid. And by the way, I think the Plaid Model S and X are the best cars on earth. There’s nothing even close, in my opinion. Just try one. Epic.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, “We keep hearing of dire energy crisis in Germany this winter. What are Tesla’s plans to combat power cuts? And will there be any delays in ramp-up in production from Giga Berlin because of this?”
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes, I can take that. I think two points on this question. The first is just that based upon everything that we know, we don’t see this as a large risk to the Company. Even if production did go down for a period of time, this is on near term, it doesn’t have any impact on the long term of the Company.
Elon Musk: But we don’t -- we have no indication whatsoever that we will have to cut our production in Germany.
Zachary Kirkhorn: No. And we put in place backup plans, and we’re working through the supply chain as well. Nearly all of our suppliers are prepared as well. So, we’ll see how this plays out, but it’s not something that we’re terribly worried about.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. And the next question is, “How is production planning going for the Cybertruck? What is the initial Phase 1 production target? When can we expect an update on pricing and final design?”
Unidentified Company Representative: I mean, as Elon said earlier, we’d be -- facilities preparations here in Giga Texas for Cybertruck. We’re still on track to enter early production in the middle of next year. We started our data builds of all of the battery body in existing...
Elon Musk: When should I drop my beta?
Unidentified Company Representative: In a few weeks. That’s going well, and we continue ramping up through the end of next year and into 2023.
Elon Musk: Great. Yes, the car is going to be sick and -- sick. That is going to be a hall of famer, next level. Sorry, it took longer than expected, but there were a few things that got in the way, like insane global supply chain shortages like FedEx, which are force majeures if everyone.
Martin Viecha: Right. Thank you.
Elon Musk: Of course. There’s Tesla Semi, of course. So, we’ll be handing over our first production Tesla Semis to Pepsi on December 1st. I’ll be there in person. And we will begin ramping up production of the Tesla Semi, which is a max low, heavy -- heavy truck. That’s a Class A truck, Class A truck.
Zachary Kirkhorn: No sacrifice to cargo capacity.
Elon Musk: Yes, exactly, very important, no sacrifice to cargo capacity, 500-mile range. Just to be clear, 500 miles with the cargo. Yes, 500 miles with the cargo on level ground. Yes, sure. Not up. It’s excellent. But the point is, it’s a long-range truck and even with heavy cargo. And the number of times people tell, no, you can’t -- it’s impossible to make a long-range heavy-duty Class A truck. And then, I’ll ask, well, what are your assumptions about what hour kilogram and what hours per mile, and they look at me with a blank stare and then say hydrogen. I’m like, no, that’s not the answer, I was looking for numbers, literally. It’s not a number. It’s [indiscernible] table. You obviously don’t need hydrogen for heavy truck. And we’ll be ramping up Semi production through next year. As I think everyone knows at this point, it takes about a year to ramp up production. So, we expect to see significant -- we’re tentatively aiming for 50,000 units in 2024 for Tesla Semi in North America. And obviously, we’ll expand beyond North America. And these would sell -- I don’t want to say the exact prices, but they’re much more than a passenger vehicle. So, with a few thousand heavy trucks of this nature, it would be worth several Model Ys.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, what is the progress of the 4680 cell ramp? And what factors determine whether vehicles get 2170s versus 4680 cells? And how will that change in the next year?
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes, ramp is going well, as Elon said. Total output is up 3x quarter-over-quarter, and production is tracking to exceed 1,000 car cells per week this quarter, as we said last quarter. Our focus is now shifting from 100% ramp to cost and further expanding production capacity in North America, as Elon also mentioned. On the 2170 versus 4680, in our factories, we really attempt to minimize factory complexity and product changeover while still making sure we get enough new product into the field to learn how it is performing. And that sort of mix is going to shift as 4680 scales here and the overall factory ramp proceeds in Texas.
Elon Musk: Right. Basically, production of 4680 ramp is growing exponentially. And yes, it’s going well. We’re just looking at this -- just going to be a major pack in the future.
Zachary Kirkhorn: [Indiscernible]
Elon Musk: Yes. And like I said, we’re -- our goal is to strive towards 1,000 gigawatt hours a year of annualized production in United States alone by Tesla, not including [indiscernible], will be on top of that.
Unidentified Company Representative: We need to get 300 to 400 terawatt hours to accomplish our goal.
Elon Musk: Yes, there’s roughly -- to transition to sustainable energy, our calculation for both stationary and vehicles is 300,000 to 400,000 gigawatt hours or 300 to 400 terawatt hours.
Unidentified Company Representative: So when you’re like one tower assembling a lot, well, a lot of terawatt hours to go by.
Elon Musk: Yes. On the cathode side -- we think it will probably be iron and most of the iron -- iron can scale to very, very high tonnage and then some nickel. The exact percentages are hard to figure out, but it’s -- probably be twice as much iron cathodes as they call, maybe more. And then there’s the manganese wildcard as well.
Unidentified Company Representative: And on that note, we’re pursuing aggressively North American iron supplies. And how -- yes, we can talk more about that at a future date.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question was on the Semi truck, which we already addressed. So I’m going to skip to the next one. Can you talk about how Tesla could adjust if we were to enter a prolonged recession, including new product prioritization, investment flexibility, new factory versus factory expansion, service support infrastructure, productivity cost measures and demand stimulation alternatives?
Elon Musk: Well, to be frank, we’re very pedal to the metal come rain or shine. So, we are not reducing our production in a meaningful way, recession or not recession.
Zachary Kirkhorn: It’s the 1% point come in.
Elon Musk: Yes, exactly. So I think the public, at large, realizes that everyone’s moving towards electric vehicles and that it’s foolish to actually buy a new gasoline car at this point because the residual value of that gasoline car is going to be very low. So, I think we have to be in a very good spot. But I wouldn’t say it’s recession proof, but it’s certainly recession resilient because basically earth has -- people both have in large part made the decision to move away from gasoline cars to electric cars. And then, in transitioning a generation to sustainable, you need solar and wind with the stationary battery pack to buffer the power. So, you have 24/7 power because the wind doesn’t go -- travel time. So that also -- we actually see the energy storage business, stationary storage, growing more like 150% to 200% a year, faster than cars by a lot.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Just to add before you jump in, Martin. Just to echo Elon’s point, I mean, I think where our cash balance is, what our forecasted cash generation is, where our margins are as a company, I mean we can withstand quite a lot of downside before we would have to dig into our capital plans, Supercharger expansion, product lineup. So, the business has done quite well over the last handful of quarters. And this is a real opportunity, I think, for the Company to press forward, in most aggressive way, as Elon has mentioned.
Elon Musk: Yes. And we try to model out like, let’s say, 2023 is a brutal recession year. Even then, we generate meaningful cash. Once you get out of that…
Martin Viecha: Great. Thank you very much. And let’s go to the last investor question, which is the progression from Tesla’s first platform with S and X to the second platform with 3 and Y, led to a 50% reduction in cost of goods sold. When do you see Tesla’s third platform being released? And what level of cost of goods sold reduction could you achieve?
Elon Musk: Well, we don’t want to talk exact dates, but this is a -- I mean, the primary focus of our new vehicle development team, obviously. At this point, we’ve done the engineering for Cybertrucks and for Semi. So, it’s obviously against what we’re working on, which is the next-generation vehicle, which will be probably about the cost of 3 and Y platform. It will be smaller, to be clear. But it will, I think, certainly become -- certainly exceed the production of all our other vehicles combined. I mean, obviously, we’re going to take everything we learned from S, X, 3, Y, Cybertruck and Semi and forward into that platform. But we -- as you’ve said to us many times, we’re on a 2-for-1 target. So, we’re trying to get to that 50% number again. It’s like, we’re going to take two. That’s exactly what [indiscernible] how we make two cars for the amount of effort that currently takes us to make one Model 3.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. Effort costs.
Elon Musk: Yes…
Zachary Kirkhorn: Half the loss, half the past, half the factory floor space.
Elon Musk: We’re twice the output. And we do believe this can be done. By the way, I should mention that -- when I said that probably now that I see a path in extremely -- very difficult path, incredible execution required, a massive amount of hard work and some luck to get to where Tesla is with as much as Apple and Saudi Aramco combined, I wasn’t including Optimus.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let’s go to analyst questions next. The first question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley. Adam, go ahead and unmute.
Adam Jonas: Great. Can you hear me?
Martin Viecha: Yes.
Elon Musk: Yes.
Adam Jonas: So Elon, would you consider vertically integrating into mining? That’s my first question.
Elon Musk: We’ll do whatever we have to. Whatever the limiting factor is, we’ll do. We do not personally constrain ourselves. We don’t particularly integrate just for the hell of particularly integrating. Like if there was a great supplier who’s better than us or we think actively is very good, or even where the economics of comparative advantage suggest that we should use that supplier, even if we could beat them, but we could use our resources to do something else that will be more productive, then we would in source in that case. But if we have to go mine, we will mine.
Adam Jonas: Okay. Thanks, Elon. My follow-up is 1 terawatt hour of manufacturing in the United States, vertically integrated. I guess, my question is, what would need to change with U.S. permitting laws to allow that? Kind of what would be your message to this administration or next? And do you think you could do a terawatt hour? What’s the going price of that? Can you do that for under $100 billion in the States? Thanks.
Elon Musk: Well, I mean, I think the message to the government would be that there should be -- I should say, we’ve actually had conversations with a number of senior government leaders, White House, Congress and whatnot. And the suggestion that we have is that there should be an expedited permitting process for anything which is critical to a sustainable energy future. So, it doesn’t make sense to put like a coal mine and a sustainable energy battery like lithium mine in the same category. Coal does not in the future, lithium does. And by the way, you can extract lithium with almost no disturbance to the local environment. So, it’s not actually ugly, nasty mine situation. So, I would recommend expedited permitting would really be helpful. Basically, a fast track environmentally -- I think in sense fast track things that are important for the environment and humanity for sure. That seems logical. And the reception has been positive. So, we’ll see if something happens with that. I think probably on this earnings call, we’re not ready to go into financial details of the -- what it will take to get there. But what we are seeing is practical improvements as we redesign the whole supply chain and all of the elements that go into battery cell. We’re figuring out dramatic efficiencies. And I think we’ll -- net result which would be that the capital required to achieve that level of output will be much less than what people think.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. Let’s go to the next question from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo. Colin, go ahead and unmute.
Colin Langan: Can you hear me now?
Martin Viecha: Yes, we can hear you.
Colin Langan: Okay. Sorry about that. Any update on full self-driving? I think you had said a couple of quarters ago, it would be available by the end of the year. Is that still possible? Is it -- would it still be like a Level 4 or Level 5 that you’re talking about? And are there any sort of regulatory hurdles you’d have to think about?
Elon Musk: We -- as I said earlier, we’re expecting to release the full self-driving software to anyone who orders the package by the end of this year. So, a separate matter as to will it have regulatory approval. It won’t have regulatory approval at that time. But the car will be able to take you from your home to your work, your friend’s house, to the grocery store without you touching wheel. So, it’s looking very good.
Colin Langan: And it would mean like Level 4, Level 5 kind of traditional definition you’re talking about?
Elon Musk: Well, there’s - this debate is like what’s the -- what are the interventions per mile and maybe safety interventions per mile. Like we’re not saying that that’s quite ready to have no one behind the wheel. It’s just that you will almost never have to touch the control, vehicle controllers. So, like when I came to Giga Texas from Brent’s house, I never touched any of the controls already here. And then there is a longer process of like called the march of nines of like how many nines reliability do you need before you could really be comfortable saying that the car could drive with no one in it. And that’s some subjectivity as to how many nines you need. But I think we’ll be pretty close to having enough nines that you’re going to have no one in the car by the end of this year. And certainly, without a question, that’s whatever in my mind next year. I think we’ll also have an update next year to be able to show to regulators that the car is safer much so than the average human.
Colin Langan: Got it. And just as a follow-up. You mentioned in the prior questions about IRA. I mean, it sounded like you thought you could get -- can you get all of it? I mean, because my interpretation is like the production credits, battery component credits for buyers seems very likely for you guys. Is the sourcing part of it possible? Because that seems like a pretty tough hurdle given how much has to be sourced from the U.S.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes. So, we have a cross-functional team that’s looking very closely. As you mentioned, the sourcing threshold increases by the year. So, we’re looking at all options and also getting some clarification from Treasury. That’s -- it’s important to say that’s only a fraction of the other credits. We do manufacture ourselves in the U.S. We manufacture the modules in the U.S. So, that’s a pretty thin. So yes, we feel confident that we’ll have a path as these incentives -- as the threshold sort of increases by the year.
Elon Musk: Yes. We’ll meet those thresholds..
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question comes from Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
Colin Rusch: The operating leverage has been pretty impressive here. And I’m curious about areas where you could invest in an incremental way, whether it’s on the R&D side or on the sales side to accelerate growth or cost reduction, or should we be thinking about this level of spend on a go-forward basis and some significant operating leverage as you scale up from here?
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. I mean, our operating leverage has improved quite a bit. It’s the lowest this quarter, I think, ever, and by a decent amount, OpEx as a percentage of revenue. I mean, our forecast is that it will keep reducing. I mean, I think the way to think about it is our total amount of operating expenses will slowly tick up as the company grows. It’s very hard to keep it flat with the rapid growth of the Company, but it’s growing much slower. So some amount of growth there, but the top line of the business is growing so quickly. So, I think there continues to be enormous opportunity to improve the overhead efficiency of the business, and we’re seeing it.
Elon Musk: Yes. Look, we are in the -- at least for now, quite in a good position of -- we’re investing in everything we can think of to possibly invest in, and we’re still generating cash. So, I guess, it gets a pretty good place to be.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. I mean, how many R&D programs are we running in parallel right now?
Elon Musk: People don’t even know old R&D stuff for that. There are some of it, but a bunch of it.
Zachary Kirkhorn: I also don’t think cash is a good gauge of how much R&D you’re doing.
Elon Musk: No. It isn’t because like it’s not like -- it’s not like engineers -- they’re not generic. So it’s just like if you could you spend $5 billion or $10 billion, that will like -- that your actual R&D -- useful product ship will be proportionate to that. It’s just not true. Engineers on -- coming off some assembly line like cookies or something.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Until we get optimistic.
Elon Musk: Get optimistic. Don’t change things. What matters is where are the most brilliant people working? And Tesla remains the -- Tesla and SpaceX are two companies where the smartest engineers want to work.
Zachary Kirkhorn: I mean, like we don’t have to spend billions of dollars to invest in the future and invent the future. Engineers are also cost conscious. And we don’t just burn the money out the window when we’re trying to do R&D. I wouldn’t stop looking at like R&D as a cash investment for...
Elon Musk: I think 1 nickel Tesla is frankly worth an infinite number of dollars. You could have like a -- almost same the number of credit shares and they would not be able to do work 1 nickel of Tesla we can do. You can’t make it up in volume.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you very much. Let’s go to the next question from George at Canaccord.
George Gianarikas: I think, at your Annual Shareholders’ event, where Elon mentioned that the prices of many of the materials used in your production have started to come off the boil. If that continues, does that give you an opportunity to adjust prices globally after several increases? Thanks.
Elon Musk: Well, we’re looking at the prices of -- prices closely. I mean, obviously, anyone can just Google what the price of -- future price of copper or steel is going to be. It’s just like one Google Search away. And everyone can see that the commodities on a go-forward basis are on a dropping a lot. But in electric vehicles, things like battery-grade lithium are still crazy expensive. So, we’ve got a mixture of things where prices are dropping and things where prices are increasing.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes. I would say quarter-over-quarter, steel -- aluminum has stopped anywhere between 17% to 20% at the same time on the battery side.
Zachary Kirkhorn: And cost of shipping has come down tremendously. Like last year, the cost of a container on the spot market from Shanghai got as high as $20,000. And now it’s $3,500, $3,600. It’s that kind of reality. We’re seeing deflation in a lot of commodities with a few exceptions as Elon mentioned on batteries.
Elon Musk: There’s more deflation than inflation.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Definitely.
Elon Musk: And again, this is publicly available information. Anyone could just Google it. And I think Cathie Wood at Ark Invest is making this point over and over again, to the Fed and the Fed is not listening because they’re looking at the rearview mirror instead of looking out the front windshield.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. Just to add a little bit more context. So, commodity increases were the highest in Q3 that we’ve seen over the last two years. And so, when indexes change, it does take time before they fully reflect.
Elon Musk: Yes. There’s latency.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. There’s latency.
Elon Musk: That’s why I say that the Fed’s decisions make sense if you’re looking out through the rearview mirror, but not if you look out the windshield. And actually we’ve got front windshield.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. And so what -- at least of what we know so far, the peak on the commodity side in Q3 -- I say peak, hopefully, it stays the peak, hopefully, it starts to come down. There is a small amount of production that we’re seeing going into our Q4 cost structure from steel and aluminum primarily, but it’s less than 10% of the total increases we’ve seen so far. So we’re optimistic here based upon what we’re seeing on the indexes for some of our cost structure that this will start to come in over time. But I just want to set expectations that there’s not some windfall of cost reduction in this space coming in Q4, maybe some as we go into next year.
Elon Musk: Yes. We’ll probably see some cost reduction in 2023. I’ll be surprised if we did not.
George Gianarikas: And just as a follow-up, this is for Elon. With your pending acquisition of Twitter and your stakes in SpaceX and Neuralink and Tesla, how much would the combined companies benefit from operating under a single super structure, if at all, like a Google Alphabet?
Elon Musk: It’s not clear to me what the overlap is. It’s not zero, but it’s -- I think we’re reaching. I’m not worried about it. I’m not an investor. I’m an engineer and a manufacturing person and a technologist. So, I actually work and design and develop products. That’s what I do. So, it’s not a -- we’re not going to have a portfolio sort of investments over it. So, I don’t know. I don’t see obvious sort of some -- get combined under an umbrella, at least right now. So, I am excited about the Twitter situation because obviously another part incredibly well. And I think it’s massive that this sort of languished for a long time, but has an incredible potential. Although, obviously, myself and the other investors are obviously overpaying for Twitter right now, the long-term potential for Twitter, in my view, is, in order of magnitude, greater than its current value.
Martin Viecha: Let’s go to the next question from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
Pierre Ferragu: Can you hear me, guys?
Martin Viecha: Yes, we can hear you now.
Pierre Ferragu: Great. I’d love to have another update on 4680, Drew. So last time we talked about it, there were -- it was a question about like scaling up with manufacturing and there were still a few things to get right. Is it fair to say that now you are at scale, and it’s just a question of logistics to get bigger? So, that’s question number one. And then, question number two, on the kind of like innovation and cost reduction and efficiency improvements kind of path that you described at the battery day, where are we today? And how much time is it going to take to deliver all the potential you outlined then?
Unidentified Company Representative: Well, I’ll take the second question first. At Battery Day, we showed a time line out to 2026 for all of the ideas we had proposed and had shared with everybody then.
Elon Musk: Yes, I’d be surprised. I think we’ll do better than that.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes. I mean, but just that’s the rough -- just give to you all -- it’s on that order. It’s not like a month. It’s not six months. It’s years. And we are executing on all of those different ideas pretty aggressively in parallel with the OpEx that some people think isn’t enough, but we’re getting it done.
Elon Musk: I mean, I’m turning down.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, yes. We’re great talent, like we find someone awesome, we bring them into the company. And people shouldn’t believe we are turning people away.
Elon Musk: Yes. I mean, it’s a hot pond but we’re solving it. And I think -- we still feel confident that 4680 will be the most competitive battery cell in the world.
Unidentified Company Representative: It’s the whole system around it, right? It’s not necessarily a specific form factor. It’s the attention to detail on how to bring costs out of the manufacturing process -- or remove processing steps.
Elon Musk: And all the way down from the mine to the cell.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes, exactly.
Elon Musk: Many steps along the way.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes. And for those who watched the YouTube videos, like our on-site cathode facilities coming together, I’m really excited about that, which is a part of the plan that we discussed on Battery Day.
Elon Musk: Yes. We’re also building lithium refinery.
Unidentified Company Representative: In Corpus Christi. So, we’re making -- putting our money where our mouths are and all the various efforts that we discussed on Battery Day. On the technical challenges and the ramp question, which is your first question of 4680, no ramp is ever easy even at the end when you’re 80% to the end, like it’s still very challenging to get to the end. And that sort of leaning out of yields, the final cycle time to achieve target. You mentioned logistics. It’s not something that we’re specifically focused on, I guess, but eventually could be a problem as we’re talking about hundreds of gigawatt hours at different sites across the United States. But I would never sit here and say we have no challenges remaining, but we’ve made a lot of progress reducing technical risk in many areas. Cycle times have dramatically improved. Yield has dramatically improved. And just walking the line here in Texas, like Martin was walking it yesterday, made some comments to me. You really see the acceleration around you. And we’ve made a ton of simplifications moving from the Fremont factory to Texas, and it’s coming to play in speed of ramp here. And of course, that’s on one line of many here in Texas. So it’s not like factory to factory. It’s a multiplication of both, simplicity and scale. So yes, we’re excited about where it’s headed.
Elon Musk: Yes. And I think, once we are fully integrated, I think we still do see a path to hold roughly $70 a kilowatt hour cell -- $70 per kilowatt hour cell, before any incentive.
Unidentified Company Representative: Before incentive.
Elon Musk: Before incentive.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. And the next question comes from Toni Sacconaghi from Bernstein.
Toni Sacconaghi: I just wanted to follow up on the 4680 cells and where we are seeing them deployed today. So, are those in the Semis that are being delivered on December 1st? Are we seeing them in Model Ys that are being produced out of Austin? And is -- do you anticipate 4680 being a gating factor for Cybertruck ramp later this year? And how do you balance the need for 4680 across Semi, Cybertruck and potentially Model Y in 2023? And I have a follow-up, please.
Elon Musk: Okay. The Semi doesn’t use 4680s. Yes. We are making Model Ys. Some of the Model Ys coming out of Giga Texas are 4680. And I think, Drew, the car you drive around is 4680 Model Y?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes. 10,000 miles.
Elon Musk: 10,000 miles. Pretty good.
Unidentified Company Representative: No problems yet.
Elon Musk: Yes. Structural pack.
Unidentified Company Representative: Structural pack.
Elon Musk: Yes. And yes, I mean -- and our output 4680 is growing exponentially. But it’s worth bearing in mind like there are entire highly competitive companies that are very smart that all they do is make battery cells. This is simply one segment of Tesla. So, it’s not a total...
Unidentified Company Representative: No, there aren’t -- there are challenges still ahead that we have not yet surpassed. No doubt.
Elon Musk: We don’t anticipate this being anything -- like Cybertruck or anything else.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you. And the last question comes from William Stein from Truist.
William Stein: I guess, I’ll go at one that I asked last time, Elon, which is your expectation for the likelihood of commercial success in each of the three major AI endeavors. FSD, sort of as imagined without a driver, the training computer and, of course, Optimus.
Elon Musk: We’ll achieve full self-driving full autonomy -- I look at that occurring is 100%. And I think we’ll -- we’re almost there. And then, of course, we’ve got to prove it to regulators and get the regulatory approvals, which is outside of our control. But anyone who’s driving full self-driving cars -- has full self-driving Beta in the car, you can see the rate of improvement. You can just experience for yourself that we are, in fact, getting there. In fact, we almost are there. And so, we’re probably -- achieving that 100%. The Optimus, probably of that being a successful product, I think, it’s also extremely high given enough time, 100%. Dojo, just maybe more of a question around Dojo, like can we be competitive with NVIDIA GPUs even as NVIDIA continues to rapidly evolve their GPUs. So the jury is out on Dojo. Dojo team, they can outperform NVIDIA for Neuralink training. The jury’s out. We will probably know -- I don’t know, next year, if that’s true or not. But we think we’ll probably -- we think it’s -- this is -- the architecture of Dojo is the right architecture to win. Yes. It depends on how well we execute in that architecture.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. I think, unfortunately, it’s all the time that we have today. So, thank you so much for your great questions, and look forward to talking to you in about three months from now. Thank you, and have a good day.
Elon Musk: Thanks, everyone."
2118,ON,3,2022,2022-10-31 12:32:06,"Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the onsemi Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Parag Agarwal, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead.
Parag Agarwal: Thank you, Liz. Good morning, and thank you for joining onsemi's third quarter 2022 quarterly results conference call. I'm joined today by Hassane El-Khoury, our President and CEO; and Thad Trent, our CFO. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.onsemi.com. A replay of this webcast, along with our 2022 third quarter earnings release, will be available on our website approximately 1 hour following this conference call, and the recorded webcast will be available for approximately 30 days following this conference call. Additional information is posted on the investor inspection of our website. Our earnings release and this presentation include certain non-GAAP financial measures. In consideration of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures under GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release, which is posted separately on our website in the Investor Relations section. During the course of this conference call, we'll make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from projections. Important factors that can affect our business, including factors that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements, are described in most recent 10-K and Form 10-Qs, in our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in our earnings for the -- earnings release for the third quarter of 2022. Our estimates or other forward-looking statements may change, and the company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changed assumptions or other events that may occur except as required by law. Now let me turn it over to Hassane. Hassane?
Hassane El-Khoury: Thank you, Parag, and thank you, everyone, for joining the call. We have closed our sixth consecutive quarter of record financial results with revenue of $2.2 billion and a non-GAAP EPS of $1.45 in the third quarter. Onsemi is now a very different company. Our strategy has proven successful and our employees are the one to thank for their commitment and dedication to excellence through these changes. Congratulations to our worldwide teams. I am proud of your steadfast and consistent execution, and I'm confident we will continue to deliver on our long-term growth plans. Now let me address the current demand environment. In the third quarter, we saw continued strong demand in the automotive and industrial end markets, with revenue increasing sequentially 11%, 5%, respectively. As we noted last quarter, we saw softening in our nonstrategic end markets of consumer and computing with both markets declining mid-single digits sequentially. We expect the weakness in these markets to persist and extend to some legacy areas of industrial, while demand and design activity remain robust for EV, ADAS and energy infrastructure. Today, more than 30% of our revenue is generated from the sales of new products at accretive margins and the third quarter new product revenue was a record for the company. Over the last 18 months, we have taken a concerted approach to improve the predictability and reduce the volatility of our business. We have transformed the company into one with a sustainable long-term growth outlook and attractive financial profile and a resilient operating model, and we made proactive structural changes to prepare us for eventual headwinds. We rationalized our product portfolio and exited $277 million of business to eliminate our exposure to price-sensitive, non-differentiated products at dilutive gross margins. We addressed price-to-value discrepancies and instilled a discipline in the company to capture the right value of our products. We executed our fab-lighter strategy with planned exits of four fabs to reduce our fixed costs. We secured long-term supply agreements that provide committed and transparent supply assurance against long-term customer demand. We decreased wafer starts by 20% from the peak in Q1 to limit the inventory build with distribution now at an all-time low under seven weeks. We drove efficiencies and streamlined operations to control OpEx below our 17% target. These changes set onsemi apart from the legacy semiconductor and we are now well equipped to navigate through the coming quarters. And while we are planning for short-term uncertainty, long-term demand for our highly differentiated intelligent power and sensing solutions continue to grow with Q3 design wins increasing 19% quarter-over-quarter. Our intelligent power revenues grew by 35% year-over-year and 6% quarter-over-quarter, driven by the accelerating momentum in electric vehicles and alternative energy. In these markets, customers are increasingly relying on us to enable their long-term product road maps with the market-leading efficiency of our solutions and our end-to-end supply chain capabilities. Our progress to our silicon carbide leadership is accelerating. As compared to our exit rate in Q4 of '21, we tripled our silicon carbide revenue in the third quarter and we continue to install capacity across the entire supply chain. We just passed the one-year mark since acquiring GTAT, and we remain on track to expand our Boule growth capacity by 5x year-over-year exiting 2022. We have also increased silicon carbide wafer fab starts by 3x this year to keep up with our Boule output, a number which we plan to double again next year. We remain on track to triple our SiC revenue in 2022 and deliver $1 billion of revenue in '23 based on committed revenue from LTSAs. To limit our long-term CapEx investments, most of the silicon carbide equipment we are installing around the world is 200-millimeter capable, and we are on track for 200-millimeter wafer qualification in 2024 and related revenue ramp in '25. Our energy infrastructure revenue is accelerating with a year-over-year increase of 70% in the third quarter. For '22, we expect our energy infrastructure revenue to grow by 60%, exceeding our target of 50% year-over-year growth. The volatility in global energy markets is driving an accelerated transition to alternative energy. And with a broad portfolio of silicon carbide and silicon power modules, we have emerged as a leader in this market. The top 10 solar inverter providers in the world collectively have a market share of 80%, and we have now signed LTSAs with 8 of them. As countries around the world strive for energy security and lower greenhouse gas emissions associated with fossil fuels, we can expect to see strong long-term growth in our alternative energy business. Traction for our silicon carbide solutions is complemented by continued growth in our silicon power business. A key differentiating advantage for onsemi is our ability to offer silicon and silicon carbide solutions across a wide range of power and voltage requirements. Many EV customers use our silicon carbide solution for rear axle and a silicon solution for the front axle. Similarly, solar inverter customers choose our silicon carbide or silicon solutions based on power and efficiency requirements. Customers who use a combination of power solutions value our ability to offer a complete range of products, which enables us to gain market share across both technologies. In the third quarter alone, our IGBT and MOSFET businesses grew 37% year-over-year, driven by high-growth mega trends in automotive and industrial. Our intelligent sensing revenue increased 43% year-over-year and 11% quarter-over-quarter. The growth was driven by additional semiconductor content required in automotive and industrial applications as well as an increase in units shipped. The number of sensors per car will continue to grow and the level of sophistication delivered by the latest generation systems is also driving ASPs higher. Safety rating requirements for new vehicles continue to increase, such as a broader field of view and higher-resolution sensors, accelerating the shift from 1 megapixel image sensors to 8 megapixel sensors for ADAS applications. Onsemi was the first to market with 8 megapixel automotive-grade sensors that provide both high detection range and a wide field of view, delivering consistent performance across all temperature and lighting conditions. Based on this industry-leading dynamic range, dark noise performance and LED flicker mitigation feature of our sensor, we are winning new designs. And in the third quarter, we displaced the large incumbent at local Japanese automotive OEMs. We expanded the internal back-end capacity to ensure we support the growth of our business and enhance our margins. Demand has been outpacing our ability to supply, but our early investments in capacity expansions allowed us to deliver 38% more automotive sensors in Q3 than in the quarter a year ago. In addition to our technology advantage, we are the only image sensor supplier with internal and external capabilities across every manufacturing stage of the supply chain for automotive and industrial sensors. We are a much stronger company today because of our commitment to our transformation and the structural changes we have implemented over the last 18 months. We have executed our strategy in one of the most challenging environments we have ever seen, not only for our industry but for the world, and we've set ourselves up for the leadership position in our target markets. Driven by exposure to secular mega trends of vehicle electrification ADAS, energy infrastructure and factory automation, we are well positioned to continue to outgrow the semiconductor market. Now I will turn the call over to Thad to provide additional details on our financials and guidance. Thad?
Thad Trent: Thanks, Hassane. Our third quarter results clearly demonstrate the success of our transformation strategy with record revenue, operating income and free cash flow. The tests we have taken to strengthen our operating model will not only enable us to get through short-term market volatility, but also propel us to scale in the long term. . Defining our primary areas of focus has enabled us to double down on intelligent power and sensing technologies and lead where we bring differentiation to the automotive and industrial markets. Our customers now choose onsemi as a strategic partner to enable their success in emerging in disruptive areas such as electric vehicles, ADAS, energy infrastructure and factory automation. Customers are entering new agreements with us, while others are expanding the scope and duration of their existing LTSAs to secure even longer supply. Revenue committed through our LTSAs increased $5.3 billion in the third quarter and now totals $14.1 billion with LTS revenue over multiple years and often includes hundreds of parts. As Hassane mentioned, we also made additional structural changes to improve the sustainability of margins by rationalizing our product portfolio and eliminating our exposure to price-sensitive non-differentiated products. So far, we have walked away from $277 million of revenue at an average gross margin of 25%. $39 million of this revenue was in the third quarter at gross margin of 35%. We continue to execute our fab-lighter strategy through the rationalization of our manufacturing footprint. Following the sale of Belgium and South Portland fabs in the first half of the year, we closed the sale of our 8-inch fab in Pocatello, Idaho in October, and we also entered into a definitive agreement to sell our 6-inch fab in Niigata, Japan. We expect the Niigata transaction to close in the fourth quarter. Exiting these four fabs will reduce our annual fixed cost by $160 million, exceeding our target of $125 million to $150 million. The full benefit of these divestitures will be realized over the next several years as we transition production to other fabs in our network further supporting our long-term gross margin expansion plans. Turning to results for the third quarter. As I mentioned, Q3 was another quarter of record results. Total revenue was $2.2 billion, an increase of 26% over the third quarter of 2021 and 5% quarter-over-quarter. We reported record revenue for our strategic end markets of automotive and industrial, which together accounted for 68% of revenue as compared to 61% in the quarter a year ago. Weakness persisted in our nonstrategic end markets of computing and consumer, offset by sequential growth in automotive and industrial of 11% and 5%, respectively. Revenue from both intelligent power and intelligent sensing is also at record levels. Intelligent power grew 35% year-over-year and intelligent sensing grew by 43% year-over-year. Additionally, all three business units reported record revenue in the third quarter. Revenue for the Power Solutions Group, or PSG, was $1.12 billion, an increase of 25% year-over-year. Revenue for the Advanced Solutions Group, or ASG, was $734 million, an increase of 20% year-over-year. And revenue for the Intelligent Sensing Group, or ISG, was $342 million, an increase of 45% year-over-year. Gross margin -- GAAP gross margin for the third quarter was 48.3% and non-GAAP gross margin was 49.3%. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined as expected by 40 basis points quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to an accelerating ramp in silicon carbide and lower factory utilization at 75% as we proactively slowed wafer starts by 20% from the beginning of the year. As indicated in previous conference calls, we expect silicon carbide start-up costs to be 100 to 200 basis points dilutive to gross margins during the initial revenue ramp. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 19.4% and non-GAAP operating margin was a record of 35.4% and an increase of 90 basis points quarter-over-quarter and approximately 1,100 basis points year-over-year. GAAP earnings per diluted share for the third quarter was $0.70, flat as compared to the quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was at a record high of $1.45 as compared to $0.87 in the third quarter of 2021. Now let me give you some additional numbers for your models. GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $634 million as compared to $322 million in the third quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $304 million as compared to $296 million in the quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating expenses were below our guidance due to a pushout of certain programs into the fourth quarter, delayed hirings and proactive management of discretionary spending across the company. For the third quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was 15.8%, and we expect to remain in the 15.5% to 16.5% range. Our GAAP diluted share count was 449 million shares, and our non-GAAP diluted share count was 441 million shares. We repurchased 1.2 million shares for $80.1 million in the third quarter. Please note that we have an updated reference table on the Investor Relations section of our website to assist you calculating our diluted share count and various share prices. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents was $2.45 billion, and we had $1.5 billion undrawn on our revolver. Cash from operations was $1 billion, and free cash flow was $731 million at a record level of 21% of revenue on an LTM basis. Capital expenditures during the third quarter were $271 million, which equates to a capital intensity of 12.4%. As we indicated previously, we are directing a significant portion of our capital expenditures towards silicon carbide and enabling our 300-millimeter capability at the East Fishkill fab. Accounts receivable of $857 million declined by $281 million and DSO of 36 days declined by 14 days quarter-over-quarter. Days of inventory declined by 7 days to 129 days from 136 in Q2. This includes approximately 23 days rich inventory to support transitions in the intending silicon carbide ramp. Distribution weeks of inventory declined to 6.9 weeks, down from 7.0 in Q2 as we proactively manage inventory at historically low levels for our distribution partners. And total debt was $3.2 billion. Turning to the guidance for the fourth quarter. A table detailing our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance is provided in the press release related to our third quarter results. Let me now provide you elements of our non-GAAP guidance for the fourth quarter. We continue to see strong demand from our automotive end markets, driven by electrification and ADAS. We are beginning to see softening in certain industrial applications, and we expect increased weakness in our nonstrategic end markets that we plan to exit as we continue our portfolio rationalization. Given the macro uncertainty, we are taking a cautious stance in our guidance for the fourth quarter. As such, we anticipate revenue will be in the range of $2.01 billion to $2.14 billion. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 47% and 49% due to lower factory utilization and the dilutive impact of ramping silicon carbide. This also includes share-based compensation of $3 million. Due to the delayed hiring and project spending in the third quarter, we expect non-GAAP operating expenses to increase to $305 million to $320 million, including share-based compensation of $21 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP OIE will be $22 million to $26 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% and our non-GAAP diluted share account for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 441 million shares. This results in non-GAAP per share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.34. We expect capital expenditures of $300 million to $330 million in the fourth quarter as we continue to ramp our silicon carbide production and invest in 300-millimeter capability to support our long-term growth we expect our capital intensity to be in the mid- to high-teen percentage range. In summary, our transformation strategy is made onsemi a more resilient and sustainable company. We have recently been named to Investor Business Daily’s 100 Best ESG Companies for 2022 as we drive to net zero by 2040. We are well positioned to invest in our and deliver long-term financial performance for our shareholders while extending our competitive lead. With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Liz to open up for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore : I guess the first one Hassane is on the revenue side and the demand side of the equation. You mentioned uncertainties and then you talked about auto staying strong, but weakness in other places. Can you just talk a little bit about the linearity of demand and maybe dive a little bit deeper into what you're seeing in the industrial market? I think people understand your other segments have been weekend markets and aren't strategically a focus for you, but the industrial side is. So a little bit of color on those metrics would be helpful.
Hassane El-Khoury : Sure, Ross. So at a high level, automotive, we see the strength -- we see the strength in orders and is supported all by the LTSA that we -- Thad and I have been talking about, including the renewed LTSAs and the extended LTSAs that cover the demand outlook that we have, and that's why we're building capacity for. You've seen the strength in our business even this quarter as we ramp the electrification as we ramp ADAS. Those are the megatrends that are driving our automotive demand. We don't see that changing in the outlook we have. On the industrial side, you see factory automation. You see renewable energy, that strength what we made including our medical business, where we see a little bit of softness in the industrial is really in the segments that are closer to the consumer. I think like white goods or so. We see that. Obviously, it's a macro-driven softness. We're watching it, but that's kind of the pockets that we see softness in the industrial.
Ross Seymore : Anything in the linearity side of the equation, just the back half of that question?
Hassane El-Khoury : It's up into to the right.
Ross Seymore : And I guess as my follow-up, one for Thad, on the gross margin side of things. It's good that you guys are still sticking with the 1 to 2 percentage point headwind from the silicon carbide ramp, but we've heard a number of your competitors talk about the difficulty in that ramp. So can you give us a little bit more color on what gives you the confidence in maintaining that hit as you're ramping so significantly? And if the revenue side of the equation and the demand side is up as high as it is, doesn't the CapEx have to rise accordingly? If you're going to do over $1 billion in revenues, how is your capital intensity staying roughly the same, shouldn't those two lines move in sync?
Hassane El-Khoury : Yes. Look, I'll cover the first part of that as far as the difficulty and let Thad talk about the CapEx. Look, yes, this is hard stuff. So I sympathize with our competitors because it's not easy stuff to do. We've been facing standard ramping challenges, but we're able to leverage our scale worldwide and the worldwide manufacturing scale that we had and the experience to address these issues as they come up. We have an excellent and very experienced operations team and that's what they do every day. We have mature processes. We have a very strong scale of manufacturing playbook. So any excursion, if they do happen, we're able to tackle it quickly, we're able to resolve it quickly, and that impact is always minimal. That's why you've seen us always focusing on the ramp and more importantly, our confidence in our ramp against the difficulties of what that silicon carbide ramp will bring in. So our targets that we've been giving and our targets that we've been talking specifically on the revenue ramp are all within our capabilities, and we do believe -- strongly believe the risks are very manageable for us.
Thad Trent : Yes. Ross, on the capital intensity, as I said in my prepared remarks, we expect our capital intensity to go up to the mid- to high single -- mid- to high teens over the next several quarters. Clearly, we're having to place orders for equipment further out to support this revenue ramp, but we do expect our capital intensity to go up. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi.
Christopher Danely : So as part of this weakness, have your pricing expectations changed for 2023? And then do you expect the weakness to bleed over into the automotive end market as well?
Hassane El-Khoury : This is Hassane. No, we don't see any movement on pricing. Obviously, we've been talking about the LTSAs that we have in our strategic products are based on the value of the products. And that does not change based on the outlook and the demand and the LTSAs provide that certainty of both volume and pricing, as we've said in the past.  So I don't expect that to be any place in the equation, not even in automotive and industrial. Obviously, where the pricing would be potentially volatile is in the businesses that are not core that we plan to exit, and that has always been part of our exit strategy that would actually be favorable to margin. So we're not worried about the pricing environment at this point.
Thad Trent : And Chris, the one thing I would add is as we see input costs going up, we are passing that on to our customers, and we'll continue to do that as well. So the pricing environment is very stable.
Christopher Danely : Great. And for my follow-up, have you seen or are you seeing any change in your lead times? And then are there any -- as part of that, are there any shortages existing for the products? Or are those all gone?
Hassane El-Khoury : Lead times is flat and is very consistent. As far as shortages, yes, we do have technologies that have our remaining in short supply versus the demand that we have. And we expect those technologies to remain supply constrained even through 2023. And those are the ones we're covered with LTSAs with our customers to make sure -- strategic customer to make sure we cover the whole BOM for our customers in order to sustain our ramps in new products next year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America.
Vivek Arya : Hassane, I just wanted to follow up on the question, Chris also asked, which is on just the supply-demand balance on the automotive side. There is a concern that automotive could be kind of this next show to drop in this rolling correction in semis. What are you hearing from your auto customers about? Are they building inventory right now? What is the supply-demand balance when you look at OEMs and Tier 1s, especially towards the first half of next year?
Hassane El-Khoury : Look, the visibility we have, there is no inventory. Are there small pockets because the golden screw problem? Yes. We work with our customers to make sure when we batch build something, we will give them a few weeks or two to three weeks ahead and then they drain it over the next few weeks. So those are -- those, I'm not worried about because we work with our customers directly.  If you look at the demand environment and where our growth and our demand is coming from, it's coming from EVs. No matter what report you look at or what customer you talk to an OEM, pure-play EV OEM or a broad OEM, there's one thing consistent. No matter what the SAAR does, they will build more EVs next year than they do this year. That's where our growth is coming from, both power and then more and more safety is getting into cars. That's where our sensing comes in. Between those two megatrends, our content is going to grow and remain growing even through '23, no matter what the SAAR does in this case, based on a lot of the prediction. So that's what gives us the confidence. Again, we have secured that outlook with LTSAs. So I'm not worried about that part of it. Is ICE engine going to have some softness because of rates going up or demand going down? Potentially. But again, the EV plants are the ones that we focus on the ones that our OEMs want to make sure they secure their EV penetration or they're going to lose share. So that's what we work on. But it is not because of any inventory. If anything, it's potentially just demand. But at this point, we don't see it for our business given our exposure to EV.
Vivek Arya : Got it. And for my follow-up, on gross margins. Thad, I think on the last call, you said you feel comfortable staying in this 48% to 50% range. So when I look at the Q4 outlook, you are at 48% already. How should we think about the puts and takes for -- from a calendar '23 perspective? Because you'll be taking on the East Fishkill fab, right, which you have outlined some headwinds from and then, of course, silicon carbide ramps. So there is some headwind and your utilization right now is 75%. So can you stay in this 48 -- plus kind of range for next year? Just what are kind of the puts and takes of gross margins for next year?
Thad Trent : Yes. Look, for '23 -- and by no means I'm trying to provide a guidance here, but for '23, you've got a couple of headwinds, as you mentioned, right, 100 basis points to 200 basis points for silicon carbide. You've got 40 basis points to 70 basis points for the East Fishkill foundry business that are -- that will be dilutive for next year. I think more than anything, this will be driven by the market dynamics in terms of what our margins will do. We're very comfortable in pricing for next year. I think it really comes down to utilization. In this environment, I think we're going to be very cautious. We're utilization and starts down already. As we go into next year, I think we're modeling it very conservatively. But we feel pretty comfortable sitting here based on what we can see today that there's a floor on our gross margins in the mid-40% range. That will be driven by the market more than anything.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.
Joshua Buchalter : This is Josh Buchalter on behalf of Matt. Congrats on result. I wanted to ask about CapEx. It seems like at least next year or the next couple of quarters, it's going to be running materially higher than the initial 12% outlook. Were there any -- can you walk us through what's driving the increased spending and in particular, why the uptick now?
Thad Trent : Yes, the uptick is to support the LTSA revenue that we continue to lock-in. I referred to the increase that we had in Q3. But clearly, we're locking up more and more open carbide wins and the ramp will go out for the years and that requirs additional capital. And that's the reason that we're -- we continue to make investments.
Hassane El-Khoury : Then obviously, Thad mentioned the equipment lead time, we want to make sure we stay ahead of it. So that's forcing us to place order materially earlier than we typically would need to. We don't want to run the risk of not being able to support our ramp. So we're being very proactive given the environment and the lead time of equipment vendors.
Joshua Buchalter : I appreciate the color there. And then you sort of mentioned the issue at one of your competitors with the yields that we found out about last week. Since then, we've been getting a lot of questions on is there any read-through into your own internal substrate ambitions? Can you walk us through your thinking there? Is it sort of just a normal part of coming up the yield curve? Or was it from your view, some specific to design decisions that they made?
Hassane El-Khoury : Look, I can't comment on what decisions or what assumptions they made. I can only comment on our business and what we are doing. We've always given the same outlook for our business as far as the ramp, as far as the margin targets at scale and the headwinds from the ramp with the start-up cost that we include all of them in our reported results. . Those have not changed, and we've been very consistent over the last few quarters since we started disclosing them. And that should give you an idea that -- and really the confidence from our side that the numbers and the models we're giving are all well within our capabilities, inclusive of any challenges we may or may not have. We've had all those baked in. Because as I mentioned, we have a very strong process and a very strong playbook given our scale of manufacturing of power products over the last two decades with IGBTs. So our ability to scale power products and walk through all the yield and walk through all the production ramp challenges that we have, we're still at exactly where we were since we started disclosing those numbers. We're meeting both the top line and the margin. And at scale, those margins will be accretive. There's no change from our side.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari : Thad, you mentioned that you guys exited from $39 million in revenue in Q3. Three months ago, you talked about, I think, $150 million in the second half of this year and an incremental $450 million in 2023. Is that still the plan? Or given the weakness in the consumer end markets, could some initiatives be accelerated?
Thad Trent : Yes. We've always said that the exit would be market driven. And the faster we could exit, the better off we'd be, we exited $35 million as you referred to. As we forward to Q4, we think we're going to exit somewhere between $65 million to $75 million in Q4. And for 2023, we still think we're on track and again this would be market dependent, but we think it will be in the neighborhood of 400 to 450 exits for next year as well. So we think we're on track for that. We think the softness in this market kind of supports this exit allows us to reallocate that capacity somewhere else that's more valuable to us. So those are the numbers that we have line of sight to right now.
Toshiya Hari : Great. And then as my follow-up, another one on gross margins. I'm curious what your plan from a wafer start or utilization rate perspective into Q4? You said 75% utilization rate in Q3. I'm guessing it continues to move south, but curious what the assumption is there? And in response to another question to a prior question you said, you expect the mid-40s to be a floor for gross margins. In making that statement, what kind of volume and pricing assumptions are you making for '23?
Thad Trent : Okay. So -- so look, when coming back, I'll start in reverse order here on the floor of what we think is the mid-40s in a downturn next year. Pricing remains very, very steady in terms of next year. We think the business is -- well, I'm not going to provide you guidance on that one, we'll let you guys figure out what that to be more market-driven. You guys will model it the way you model it. What was the first part of the question?
Toshiya Hari : Utilization rates in Q4, what the plans are? 
Thad Trent : Yes. Thanks for the reminder. So Q2, we were at 77%. We dropped to 75% here in Q3. As we look forward into Q4, again, we'd assume incremental softness here. So we think it's flat to down slightly in Q4 as our assumption.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rajvindra Gill with Needham.
Rajvindra Gill : Question on the guidance on the top line. Can you give us any kind of direction by the nonstrategic or strategic?
Thad Trent : Yes, Raji, let me break it out by end market. Auto, we think, is going to be up kind of low single digits. We think industrial is down kind of mid-single digits. And we think our other category, nonstrategic, is down kind of mid- to high single digits. That's the way that we think about the guidance there.
Rajvindra Gill : Got it. So on the industrial being down mid-single and kind of seeing a deceleration in kind of the year-over-year growth rate, quarter-by-quarter, the growth rate has been decelerating. And obviously, we've heard commentary about softness in industrial from some competitors. I'm just curious if you think this softness in white goods is just kind of relegated to that particular market. And that seems to be -- even if it is relegated to that small segment of the market, it's still a relatively decent percentage of your industrial if you're seeing kind of a mid-single decline quarter-over-quarter. So just wondering if that's the case? Or are there other kind of indications that you're seeing with respect to your customers? Outside of alternative energy, are you seeing slower industrial production in medical or other different segments?
Hassane El-Khoury : Now look, the industrial -- factory automation, alternative energy is going to be up. The white goods, I gave it as an example of what we call legacy industrial, meaning the industrial segment that is the closest to the consumer, and that is driven by consumer spending or even real estate. The industrial market is very broad, and we're starting to see the softness kind of in multiple of these legacy industrial areas. Our focus specifically is on factory automation and alternative energy. And that's what we've really been investing in, in driving new products through, and that remains strong and that remains growing. But obviously, automotive or industrial is a very broad market.
Rajvindra Gill : And just for my follow-up, I appreciate that Hassane. Just that on the OpEx, it's been kind of bold quarter-by-quarter based on kind of pushouts programs. So 12.5 for Q4. As you kind of go into 2023, wondering how you're thinking about the OpEx ramp? Is there going to be continued investment in R&D? I'm just curious if there -- you obviously are managing an OpEx system that's going to be conducive if the demand environment slows down, same thing where you're managing inventory. Just curious how you're thinking about the OpEx controls into calendar 2023?
Thad Trent : Yes. Look, we've already been managing discretionary spending very carefully. Some of the lumpiness, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks with the timing of some R&D projects. What you'll see us continue to do is reallocate some of the spending into R&D as we grow. As we think into next year, we've set our model at 17%. We've been running well below that, I think, kind of too low at this point. As I look into next year, I don't think we're going to get to 17%. I think we're probably going to be somewhere around 15.5%, maybe max out at 16% of the top end. That would be my thinking for next year. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tore Svanberg with Stifel.
Jeremy Kwan: Yes. This is Jeremy Kwan calling for Tore. I guess just two quick questions here. The first, regarding your long-term supply agreement, are there any upfront cash commitments or peak pace associated with this? I just want to get a sense of any kind of financial commitments that your customers have given.
Thad Trent : Can you repeat the first part of your question, you broke up a little bit?
Jeremy Kwan: Sorry about it, Thad. Yes, the long-term supply agreement, just wondering if there's any prepayments associated with these?
Thad Trent - CFO: Yes, absolutely. I mean our customers have been co-investing with us. We've been saying that for a while. That's -- that has to be prepayments, it can be on payments for capital. It could be co-investing in R&D, that's very typical.
Jeremy Kwan: Any chance you could quantify that for us?
Thad Trent : No. They vary by agreement and duration. So I wouldn't want to try and put a number on it.
Jeremy Kwan: Got it. Okay. And then just circling back to the pricing question. Are there -- is there anything that you might want to highlight in terms of maybe the timing of these price increases that you're passing along versus the price increase that you're seeing in the supply chain? And any way to quantify this as well?
Hassane El-Khoury : No, we're not giving quantitative because we're just passing whatever we get. So from the outlook and from our margin, you can think about it as being neutral. So as we get it, we pass it on. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan.
Harlan Sur : Your intelligent sensing group, primarily image sensor solutions, which is where you have quite a bit of the portfolio, which is outsourced as -- I remember it was capacity constrained back last year. This business has been outperforming this year. I think it's up like 41% for the first nine months. I assume you guys are getting better capacity allocation from your foundry partners. Is image sensor demand still tracking higher than supply and can you just give us an update on the in-sourcing initiatives?
Hassane El-Khoury : Yes. Demand -- look, I'll give you the demand environment. Obviously, demand still outpaces supply based on a lot of the penetration that we see in ADAS for automotive, which is agnostic of EVs or ICE engines. So a very healthy demand environment and more importantly, very healthy position that we hold in that market. We also have a lot of new products that we've launched, both in automotive and industrial that are fit for purpose for these markets individually and that is driving some of our new product ramps as well. . On the supply side, we have been getting incrementally more supply over time. Every quarter, we get incrementally more as our road map with our foundry partners are. And internally, what we've been doing also is expanding some of our -- that I mentioned in my prepared remarks, increasing some of our capacity for back-end in order to get closer to the demand environment as we get more wafers from foundry partners. So both of these have enabled us to increase our units as well as our revenue because of the higher ASPs given the technology advancements that I talked to you about in my prepared remarks. We don't see that slowing down. We're going to keep increasing capacity, we're going to keep getting more wafers from foundry partners, and that's going to keep driving the growth in that business even through next year.
Harlan Sur : Great. Hassane, you also talked about this a little bit in your prepared remarks. Being a leader in power, you guys have a pretty broad portfolio of solutions, right? So in addition to the silicon carbide traction inverter for EV and onboard charging, like how successful has the team been in also pulling in, for example, the gate driver module, which uses your MOSFET portfolio, the front-wheel drive, IGBT traction inverters? This, I assume, is not included in the $4 billion pipeline, but it does sit alongside your silicon carbide solutions and represent sort of further content gain opportunity. So how successful has the team been in sort of attaching these other components, two-year silicon carbide pipeline?
Hassane El-Khoury : That's a good question. So the team has been very successful. What we -- what I refer to as cross-selling, it's something that our sales team drives with the business unit that I track as well. So just to give some more specifics, the $4 billion committed revenue we talked about for silicon carbide, that's purely on the silicon carbide. Thad talked about our LTSAs in general being north of the $14 billion and increasing more than $5 billion last quarter and including hundreds of parts. So you can think about that's the cross-selling at a customer where we want to make sure that everything on that BOM that the customer needs is secured in the LTSA. The worst thing you can have is have 99 parts, and you're missing the golden screw from us also, and we can ship to 99. So we have the full content on per BOM. And per new designs, we pull a lot of our other content that will support that system level sell. I've mentioned in the past, we do that even with image sensors where new and highly advanced image sensors also carry a PMIC with them. So it's not just power. Within power, we carry power even our intelligent sensing business as a cross-selling. So we do that as a matter of day to day. Our sales team is focused on it, and our business units are focused on it.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.
Timothy Arcuri : I wondered if you could quantify in Q4, the gross margin headwinds from the underutilization and then maybe help us think about does that get better in Q1 or worse?
Thad Trent : Well, look, the way we're thinking about the market right now is we think it remains soft. I think utilization kind of stays in this level, maybe even goes backwards slightly as we go into Q1. So I don't expect that to improve just based on what we're all seeing in the news. In terms of the quantification, we said silicon carbide is 100 basis points to 200 basis points dilutive there. And the utilization is a factor in addition to that.
Timothy Arcuri : Okay. And then, I guess, can you help quantify -- you just talked about the LTSAs, and it sounds like most of the increases you're kind of sweeping other content inside of the silicon carbide business given the importance of that. Can you just talk about how much of the $2.2 billion right now is moving inside of LTSAs? I guess the question really goes to -- there's just a lot of general skepticism typically around LTSAs. And maybe can you just talk broadly about any change in customer behavior inside of an LTSA versus revenue that moves outside of an LTSA?
Thad Trent : Yes. Look, as I said, customers are extending their LTSAs. They are coming back and increasing them as well. So I think that the aim here has been very consistent with our customers trying to lock up long-term supply. And just to clarify, our LTSA -- our committed revenue in LTSA over a multiyear period now is over $14 billion. It was up over $5 billion -- $5.3 billion in the third quarter. So you can see that this is customers locking in supply on silicon carbide, but beyond that as well across the entire portfolio. What we're not doing is we're not doing LTSAs on the business we're looking to exit, obviously, because -- we don't want to have a commitment there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Baird.
Tristan Gerra : Just a follow-up on this. So in industry-wide in analog outside of LTSAs, we know that another companies had implemented earlier this year, noncancelable orders to. So are those holding into next year or at least into the first half of next year in terms of how you're dealing with or outside of your LTSAs?
Hassane El-Khoury : Yes. Look, it's not about just, it's also with the end customers. Obviously, LTSAs is a broader view, and it's a multiyear. As far as NCNR, it depends. We've had -- we have NCNRs that extend up to 12 months of backlog. But it always remains our cautious outlook even if you have an NCNR order, but there's inventory at the disty will you still ship it? You've seen us be very, very disciplined on inventory and trying to make sure we -- it doesn't balloon out of control. We've kept it around the seven weeks. We're comfortable with the visibility we have at that. We have the NCNR orders to support all of the demand that we have, but we are very cautious and disciplined about how much we ship and when we ship it because we have to ensure that it does POS at the end of the day during the quarter. So it doesn't get above our expectations as far as weeks of inventory with our partners.
Thad Trent : Yes. Tristan, I would add that of our $14.1 billion of LTSA, it does not include the NCNR orders. So when you combine the two, we have very good visibility into our backlog and what we're truly.
Tristan Gerra : Okay. That's great. And then for my follow-up, it looks like based on the specs provided on your website, your silicon carbide products already at 650 volts. I know there's some silicon carbide products from other suppliers out there going all the way to 1,200 volt. So could you talk about this in terms of specs? And what's your expectation? Because I'm assuming that increasing the voltage also increases your TAM within EVs.
Hassane El-Khoury : Yes, I don't know where you're referring to, but we have 1,200 volts already in production and supplying to customers. So I'm very comfortable with our road map and the breadth of our portfolio, both in silicon and silicon carbide, but our 1, 200 volts is already in production, and it has been.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho.
Vijay Rakesh : Just a quick question. On the silicon carbide side, obviously, you're seeing pretty solid traction. Just wondering if you could give us an idea of what the dollar content you're getting per car in terms of the range, if you can as you go from a dual motor to quad motor, et cetera?
Hassane El-Khoury : Yes. Look, Vijay, I'll give you a couple of comments because it depends on how much power for the drivetrain or the inverter and so on. So it's a broad range. But just to give you an idea for an equivalent reference. For us on EVs, you can think about incremental content, it's about $700 for an EV versus ICE. Obviously, the majority of it is from the traction inverter, then you add onboard chargers and so on.  And then as far as the ASP, you can think about it as the silicon carbide ASP is about 3x that of an IGBT. So that gives you kind of an apples-to-apples as far as if you normalize it on a specific power output.
Vijay Rakesh : Got it. And then the second question is, as you look at your design win pipeline is growing very nicely. You talked about how you're displacing some legacy suppliers as well incumbents. Just wondering if you could kind of go through what are the top 3 things that are helping you drive the design wins, I think that would be very helpful? And if we had an updated backlog you can cover backlog number there as well?
Hassane El-Khoury : So from an overall, obviously, there are two things driving a lot of our design wins and the new product revenue and all of the forward-looking revenue confidence. One is always starts with technology. Our technology and a lot of our focus area and our strategic area is compelling, and it's very competitive against what's in the market today. Obviously, we've talked about silicon carbide and why we win, both on the technology and the packaging as far as module, getting more power in a smaller and smaller module, reducing costs and so on and improving efficiency. So that's on the silicon carbide. Image sensing, I'll give you a few examples. LED flicker mitigation is a great example of where our superior technology in a market need where a lot of the signs are LED and standard camera or a competitive camera cannot detect an LED sign. We have technologies that address that. Global shutter is what is needed for detection and/or factory automation. Every single strategic market we are going after, we have products that are tailored made with specific technology to address real problems that the customers have. That's what creates value. And that's what, number one, puts us in the lead for new designs and also puts us in the lead when there's a refresh and the design for us to capture share. But it always starts with technology and capability.
Operator: That concludes today's question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the call back to Hassane El-Khoury, President and CEO, for closing remarks.
Hassane El-Khoury : Thank you all for joining us today. Our teams have yet again delivered outstanding results in the third quarter. I'm excited about our future as we have not yet reached our full potential and we have everything we need to lead in the fastest-growing markets, superior technology, committed customers and a talented workforce that will continue to expand to support our long-term growth. And as always, we remain consistent and committed to executing with the highest degree of excellence. We look forward to seeing you at various investor events during the quarter. Thank you. 
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
2133,RIVN,3,2022,2022-11-09 19:58:05,"Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Rivian Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. [Operator Instructions].  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Tim Bei. You may begin.
Tim Bei: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Rivian's third quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us on today's call, we have RJ Scaringe, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Claire McDonough, our Chief Financial Officer. A copy of today's shareholder letter is available on our Investor Relations website. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today only and will include statements related to our business that are forward-looking statements under federal securities laws, including, without limitation, statements regarding our market opportunity, industry trends, business operations, strategy and goals, our production ramp and manufacturing capacity expansion, our proposed joint venture with Mercedes Benz, our future products and product enhancements, including R2, and our expectations regarding vehicle deliveries. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties associated with our business, which are described in our SEC filings and today's shareholder letter. During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in today's shareholder letter. With that, I'll turn the call over to RJ who will begin with a few opening remarks.
RJ Scaringe : Thanks, Tim. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Just before the call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of our progress over the recent months. I encourage you to read it for additional details around some of the items we'll cover on today's call. Having just passed the 1-year anniversary of the start of production for the R1T, I want to take this opportunity to highlight the progress our team has made this past year. We launched 4 variants across our consumer and commercial vehicle platforms. We are awarded MotorTrend's Truck of the Year, along with other media accolades. We produced more than 15,000 vehicles as of September 30, and we continue to ramp our production to fully utilize our normal facility. In addition, we also launched our go-to-market operations and services, which include our physical service centers and mobile service vehicles, delivery operations, FleetOS, financing, insurance, remarketing and the Rivian Adventure Network, our in-house developed and produced network of DC fast chargers. It's been rewarding to see the excitement and enthusiasm for our first generation of products. We believe we're in a unique position during a transformational time for the auto industry. Production of our designed and developed products continues to ramp at our large-scale vertically integrated production facility in Normal. We have significant demand visibility as evidenced by our consumer and commercial backlog.  We have a strong balance sheet with $14 billion of cash that offers us the flexibility to navigate these uncertain economic times and look for capital-efficient methods to drive growth. We remain focused on ramping production in a cost-efficient manner, and we've seen improvement across our cost of goods sold, operating expenses and capital expenditures over the past quarter. The third quarter was another record for the Rivian team. We produced over 7, 300 vehicles across the R1T, R1S, and EDV product lines. Our key focus remains ramping our normal facility to achieve the targeted annual capacity. As part of this progress, we reached a key milestone recently as our second manufacturing shift started producing vehicles. It takes extraordinary coordination to ramp a highly vertically integrated facility of this size, and I'm grateful for all the hard work that's gone into it. We continue to see strong demand for our products. As of November 7, we had over 114,000 net preorders and reservations for our R1 vehicles. As a reminder, these orders are from the United States and Canada only and are net of deliveries and cancellations. The third quarter was also important for our commercial business. In early September, we announced the signing of an MOU with Mercedes-Benz for a strategic partnership for commercial electric vans in Europe, the world's largest van market. We continue to deliver EDVs to Amazon and expand our FleetOS offering. Amazon has delivered over 5 million packages with the EDVs and is now making deliveries in over 100 cities. Every two weeks, I spend a few days driving the EDV as my daily driver. It's a great way for me to personally experience what the drivers of these vans actually experience, everything from the seating position to the unique pocket door to the overall vehicle dynamics, it's a really exciting package. And at stoplights or parking lots, the enthusiasm I get to see firsthand from folks that are seeing it for the first time or asking questions about it, it's really exciting and we're happy to be to help raise the bar for electrifying logistics. As we continue to look for opportunities to scale our platforms, production and technologies in capital-efficient ways, we're strategically investing in our in-house technologies, which will enable differentiated product performance and capabilities while also delivering structural cost advantages. Our in-house software capabilities allow us to be agile and provide customers with an improved experience. On the hardware side, we're excited to ramp production of our fully in-house drive unit. The Enduro production lines are coming to life now. It's great to see not only the vertically-integrated motor but also the design of our manufacturing lines. In early 2023, we plan to introduce the Enduro motor and our first LFP battery pack into the commercial van line in Normal. These changes will enable optimized performance at a significantly lower cost. It's imperative that we get the introduction of these new technologies right so we've allocated meaningful time to quality loops and process checks in the first quarter. We are excited about the progress our teams are making across future vehicles and technologies as well as improving the performance and cost of our current offerings. While we haven't shown any of our future products yet, I couldn't be more excited about the work happening on our next platform. The smaller size of this platform is enabling some wonderfully unique products and we are looking forward to be able to show these to the world. I want to thank our dedicated team members, suppliers and importantly, our customers and communities for the tremendous support you continue to show us.  With that, I'll pass the call over to Claire.
Claire McDonough: Thanks, RJ. I want to echo your excitement around the third quarter results and the progress the team is making. During the third quarter, we produced over 7,300 vehicles and delivered nearly 6,600 vehicles, which was the primary driver of the $536 million of revenue we generated. We recorded negative gross profit of $917 million in the third quarter. We continue to be impacted by the high fixed cost structure associated with running high-volume production lines at low volumes while we ramp. We recorded a $696 million accounting adjustment in the third quarter related to LCNRV. As discussed on prior calls, the LCNRV adjustment writes down the value of certain inventory to the amount we anticipate receiving upon vehicle sale after considering the future costs necessary to ready the inventory for sale. The increase in our LCNRV charge represents the vast majority of the increase in cost of goods sold as compared to the second quarter of 2022. The increase in LCNRV compared to the second quarter is primarily due to an increase in overall inventory and firm purchase commitment values ahead of the start of our second manufacturing shift. In addition, similar to prior quarters, gross profit for the quarter was also impacted by the inflation of our raw materials as well as supply chain challenges, which caused the need for expedited shipping. Operating expenses grew by an approximate $160 million as compared to the same quarter last year. The primary driver of this increase is stock-based compensation expense, which we did not recognize prior to our November 2021 IPO. When looking at our operating expense this past quarter versus the second quarter of 2022, we saw a nearly $150 million decrease.  Our Q3 operating expenses reflect our ongoing prioritization of investment in our core and vehicle technologies and customer experience while continuing to drive additional focus and cost optimization across the business. We continue to focus on deploying capital in the most efficient way and ensuring that every dollar spent helps us towards our long-term financial targets, which in turn helps accelerate the impact we can deliver. Our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter was negative $1.3 billion, which is flat to the second quarter of 2022. We ended the third quarter with about $14 billion of cash on hand. We continue to monitor the economic environment and believe we have a high level of flexibility regarding the cadence of our growth investments. We remain confident in our ability to fund operations with cash on hand through 2025, excluding the impact of our investment in the contemplated joint venture with Mercedes-Benz. We continue to work with the state of Georgia and the Joint Development Authority on our second domestic production facility. We are adjusting the timeline for launching the R2 platform and expect it will launch in 2026. We expect the R2 platform will unlock a massive global market expansion opportunity for Rivian and are excited about the development work that's underway. We are also reaffirming our 2022 full year guidance of 25,000 total vehicles produced. The supply chain continues to be our largest source of uncertainty as we continue to ramp production. We've experienced five days of production downtime in October and November due to a lack of supply of a key component, which limited our quarter-to-date production.  In the fourth quarter of 2022, we expect the in-transit time from rail shipments, coupled with an increase in volumes from the ramp of our second shift towards the end of the quarter, will cause a significant discrepancy between production and deliveries. In addition, we're reaffirming our 2022 adjusted EBITDA guidance of negative $5.45 billion. We're lowering our capital expenditure guidance to $1.75 billion due to our streamlined product road map and the shift of certain capital expenditures to 2023. As RJ mentioned, we have over 114,000 net R1 preorders as of November 7. As we ramp our production and deliveries, we believe preorders will become an increasingly less important measure of our fundamental progress as a business. Going forward, we no longer plan to provide an updated preorder number during our quarterly earnings calls. In closing, I want to reiterate our confidence in our long-term financial targets. We see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high teens EBITDA target and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target.  With that, let me turn the call back to the operator to open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America. Your line is open.
John Murphy: Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for all the info. A couple of quick ones. That announcement that you're not going to provide on the preorders anymore. I am just curious what the motivation is for that. Are we getting to a point where the preorders are getting so robust or long that ebbs and flows in those relative to production might not actually be that informative? I mean, what's kind of the driving factor in that change in communication?
Claire McDonough: Thanks, John. This is Claire. As it pertains to the preorders, our sentiment was more so that we're one year post our start of production as an organization. We're starting to really ramp up our production and the deliveries associated with our R1 platform, so don't feel like it's really a meaningful metric for us to continue to provide overall to the market.  Obviously, given the 114,000-unit backlog that we currently have, that extends us into 2024 as well, it's a robust backlog of demand that we have for our vehicles. And this is going to be consistent with what you'll see from us on a go-forward basis as it pertains to additional new product launches as well.
John Murphy: Okay, that's helpful. And then RJ, on the Mercedes JV, I just wonder if you could give us an update there. I mean, I think a skeptic could say, hey, listen, you would have been able to enter and be successful in the European market ultimately on your own over time, just given your product. But an optimist might say, hey, listen, that opens up that market that much faster and provides more robust growth sooner. Just curious if you can kind of maybe couch the direction there on optimist versus skeptic and any other updates you might be able to give us there.
RJ Scaringe: Sure, John. Yes, Mercedes is, in terms of a partner and somewhat to be looking at how do we accelerate electrification faster, there's very much aligned mentality, aligned mentality around the need to electrify, aligned mentality on how we think about products and the position of products and the execution of products. So it's a relationship and a partnership that we're working towards that we think kind of on both sides to accomplish more together. Ultimately, as we think about this, as we look at this market, it is an important and large space for the commercial van space in Europe. And we felt Mercedes was a great partner to be looking at this with.
John Murphy: Okay. And then if I could just sneak one more in. The delta in deliveries versus production, Claire, will that continue to expand over time? Or are we kind of looking at sort of a onetime gap opening up here in the fourth quarter? Just trying to gauge the revenue recognition versus the production so we can think about that for our models go forward.
Claire McDonough: The Q4 gap will be exacerbated here in particular because we have the second shift that that's coming online and really ramping from a production perspective that back-weights the volumes from a production perspective in the second half of the quarter. And then that, coupled obviously with the shift that we've had to rail and then the holiday period where customers are a little bit harder to find in that last week of December that will be a driver of that core shift for us. Obviously, what we don't deliver in Q4 rolls into the upcoming quarter, so you start to normalize over time as we ramp closer to the installed capacity within the plant in Normal. So the gap should narrow on a percent basis on a go-forward basis.
John Murphy: That’s very helpful. Thank you very much, guys. 
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Adam Jonas with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Adam Jonas: Hi, everybody. So my first question, Claire, is if I do the calculation quarter-on-quarter sequentially from 2Q to 3Q, your revenue increased $172 million, and your gross loss, if you will, improved by $182 million if you exclude LCNRV, okay, which is substantial -- more substantial this quarter than last quarter. So on my math, your improvement in gross profit ex LCNRV was actually greater than your change of revenue. Now there may be some stuff going on sequentially and maybe there were some really unusual other knocks on gross profit last quarter, but I just wanted to kind of make sure my math is right and to see if there was what you could highlight sequentially that got a lot better underlying, excluding the LCNRV, to draw that improvement of gross profit that actually exceeded the change in revenue. Thanks.
Claire McDonough: Thanks, Adam. So unpacking the question first about LCNRV itself, it's important to understand there are different components. So the way to your calculation, which is entirely excluding it, is not necessarily the way that I would direct you to look at it. The segment you may want to look at instead is really looking, in particular, at the change in increase in LCNRV versus the complete exclusion of it. The way to think about it is LCNRV is really accelerating the recognition of losses as we take in raw materials and have our firm commitments, which we're then grossing up to say, what is the cost for us to turn these materials into that end-state vehicle themselves? And so as it pertains to the quarter, we get both the benefit of a reduction of bill of materials and conversion costs associated with sort of the baselining of inventory levels if inventory were held constant within those two quarters. And so that's why we look to that increase as you look at that calculation in particular. And so if you're looking based off of your own metrics, there, right, it's more of an 11% increase in that cost of goods sold on a comparable basis versus a 47% increase in deliveries in aggregate. So we've made meaningful progress to sort of close the loop on that front, but I wanted to just direct you to some of those nuances.
Adam Jonas: Okay, I appreciate that. Thanks. And just as a follow-up on reservations. Can you tell us where -- give us an update on where you're getting your customers from what they currently drive? And then same thing for your deliveries, just to kind of get a sense, how many are coming from Tesla or trucker SUV owners? Any other color there would be great? Thanks.
RJ Scaringe: Sure, Adam. One of the things we targeted in developing the products and thinking about R1T and R1S, these are really flagship products that introduce the brand, really open the brand umbrella for us to, over time, add additional products. And because of that, we wanted them to be pulling -- the target state, I should say, was to be pulling customers from a broad spectrum of vehicle formats and form factors as well as brands. And sitting here today, we now have the actual so look at how we did relative to target state. And we're really pleased that we do have a really diverse set of customers. So certainly, customers are coming out of -- some customers coming out of Teslas. But really, there's no single brand that represents a significant percentage of our overall demand. But I would want to add a couple of really important metrics, the first of which is the vast majority of our customers, close to 90%, do not currently own an EV, meaning most of our customers are new EV customers, which is really important from a mission point of view because it means the brand, the products we've created, it's helping -- we're helping to create new EV customers, who’re driving that transition. And the second is the number of customers that are buying an R1T that haven't owned a pickup before.  That's well over a majority of the customers haven't owned a pickup before, and they're being introduced to it through a very different type of pickup, of course, something that's very lifestyle-focused. And in a similar sense, the R1S is, in many cases, folks are moving into it as a prelaunch SUV is something they've aspired to but haven't been able to make that jump before, in many cases, because of desires around efficiency and what we can deliver in a full-size 3-row SUV with something that's great on-road and off-road. It's really pulling in a broad spectrum of customers.
Adam Jonas: Thanks, RJ.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with RBC. Your line is open.
Joseph Spak: Thanks so much, everyone. Claire, I want to go back to Adam's question because I was sort of pulling on a similar thread here and I'm trying to sort of update real time for what you just said. So if I just look at auto COGS divided by deliveries in the second quarter, no adjustments, and then I do the same thing in the third quarter but adjust for the increase in the inventory adjustment, as you just suggested, it still seems like that COGS per unit, while still obviously above what you're selling the vehicle for, did improve like over 30%.  So can you just help us understand, like is that not right? Like is there something with the accounting that does not allow you to do that calculation?
Claire McDonough: No, that's absolutely right. As I had mentioned, right, as you factor the sort of apples-to-apples comparison of the way that you're looking at it, Joe, you would see a 33%-plus improvement on a quarter sequential basis.
Joseph Spak: Okay. Maybe I misheard that. I thought I heard 11%. Okay. And is that...
Claire McDonough: Dollars is 11% growth of dollars, but that is off of -- right, the fact that we're also increasing 47% on a deliveries basis. So you're really netting the two of those.
Joseph Spak: Okay. And so that's sort of the leverage you're seeing in the plant? Or is there anything with mix between R1s and the vans in the quarter that impacted that?
Claire McDonough: The biggest driver that we've seen on a quarter sequential basis is just some of the cost efficiency that we're driving within the plant, us also moving beyond some of the start-up-related costs as well. That's a key enabler for us as we've seen and continue to moderate down that cost of goods sold per vehicle.
RJ Scaringe: The other thing just to jump in here, Joe that we have is -- we've launched multiple vehicles in parallel. So the start-up costs that Claire referred to, we were seeing all of those stacked up on top of each other, four different vehicles launching and ramping largely at the same time.
Joseph Spak: Okay. Thanks a lot. And RJ, I guess this is a second question. A couple of quarters ago, you talked about the revised plans, some changes to CapEx timing, et cetera. I'm just wondering, in light of IRA and kind of appreciate you're still probably evaluating that. But like does that cause you to reevaluate the plans again and maybe accelerating or reaccelerating some of that in-house cell development? Because I think that was one of the things that maybe had a sort of slight pushup, but the return profile on that investment seems to be greatly accelerated versus what you were thinking at the time and then obviously also directly impacts the financials of the rest of your business. So just wanted to get your thoughts on that.
RJ Scaringe: Yes. I mean, there's -- as you know, there are still some moving pieces with IRA, but we think this is a really powerful step and an important step by the U. S. government to really both create strong tailwinds not only for electrification but also for the build-out of a domestic supply base around battery cells. And so this is -- we couldn't be more excited about this, and it's certainly driving shifts in how we think about the overall battery supply chain. And it's not just the cells, it's also the core materials that go into the cells, lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, some of the key precursor materials are areas we're spending a lot of time focusing on. And not only making sure we have security supply as we think out through the end of the decade, but making sure that, that supply qualifies for all the benefits associated with the IRA bill. Now at the cell level, particularly important for us as we think about our two platform vehicles, this is something that has long been the plan to have domestically produced cells that would go into the vehicle. This just puts greater emphasis and importance on achieving that and achieving that as quickly as possible.
Joseph Spak: Okay, thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.
Rod Lache: Hi, everybody. You mentioned again that you have the funding through late 2025 with cash on hand, excluding this JV plant. And just wanted to confirm what that means. So by late 2025, you will have ramped up Normal and presumably funded most of Georgia assembly. I just wanted to make sure that, that's correct. And you didn't mention anything about -- anything new at least about vertical integration into batteries or cathode active material. Is that part of your funding plan just to the extent that it's important, particularly for the R2?
Claire McDonough: Thanks, Rod. As we've talked about in the past, we remain confident in our cash on hand through 2025. And as we've also spoken about, we will opportunistically evaluate, right, opportunities for us to invest in high-growth, high-return options for Rivian on a go-forward basis. And as you heard from RJ's last comments there around a lot of the work that our team is doing across the board as it pertains to securing cell raw materials and the R&D and build-out and capabilities that we have in-house here. Those are all things that we're currently evaluating and working on as an organization as well. And the embedded guidance that we do have does certainly consider some meaningful investments in that cell road map as we sit here today and look out at the building blocks for that future state opportunity. What the guidance doesn't include today is really much more of the large-scale manufacturing build-out of our cells, which would follow, obviously, the development and build-out of our R2 platform as we've spoken about in the past. So those are our core items that I just wanted to call out as you think about the building blocks and road map to that cash on hand through 2025.
Rod Lache: Okay, all right. That's helpful. Is it possible that, that can change prior to the ramp of the R2? Or is that something that just it takes a longer time to kind of get that pulled together?
RJ Scaringe: Rod, as Claire said, a lot of what's already built into our plan is the development and pilot -- the funding for all the development pilot activities associated with our domestic cells as well as building out some of the raw material cathode active material supply chain. But above and beyond that, as we think about what the future lines look like, part of that planning exercise is to create opportunities for us to take a decision with enough time in advance to have impact in that 2026 and beyond time frame. So those are decisions we'll take. And we look at them through the lens of recognizing the need to raise capital for things that we believe have very strong return profiles. Building domestic battery cells is one of those certainly. I'd also say that this is something that we view as a must-have over time, so it's just a question of how quickly those activities ramp up in terms of production capacity.
Rod Lache: And just lastly, you're going to be producing over 10, 000 vehicles in the fourth quarter. And I presume that, that benefits, to some extent, but not fully from the second shift and you're still constrained by supply chain. Can you just give us any color you might have on what the -- where you are in the S-curve now, what the trajectory might look like from here just because there are -- obviously, there are people who are reporting some push-out for the R1S vehicles. So wondering if that has any implications for what the ramp looks like.
RJ Scaringe: Yes. The second shift is now up and running. We're building vehicles on if those vehicles are in delivered to customers, which is exciting. In ramping a second shift, of course, it's additional team, it's additional -- it's a lot of additional hours every week of time building vehicles. But it does have a ramp curve associated with it. And now while the ramp curve is much faster than what we went through on the first shift, as we brought the lineup and brought the plant up, it's not as if it starts immediately at 100% output. So we're going through that ramp now. It is going well, as you called out in your question. We're very much cognizant of the limitations of supply chain, and that was -- as you recall, we talked about this in the last call, that was actually what drove the timing of the second shift coming online. It was we want to ensure before we brought on a large group of additional team members, make sure that we would have the parts to build the vehicles. So as we stand here today, that is ramping. It's going well. The first shift continues to make improvements. As Claire referenced before, we're very much focused not just on the ramp but also on operational efficiencies and cost efficiencies, many of which come implicitly just through achieving higher output of the plant and leveraging more of our fixed costs more efficiently across more volume. But we're very much focused on fully ramping the second shift and going into 2023 strong.
Rod Lache: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Charles Coldicott with Redburn. Your line is open.
Charles Coldicott: Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. My first one, on the R2 and the delay to 2026 from 2025 previously, can you talk a bit about what's changed there, and maybe also how this changes, if at all, your investment plans for the period up to 2025?
RJ Scaringe: Sure, Charles. This doesn't represent a material change in the product by any means. This is really reflective of making sure that the production site is prepared. We have the appropriate amount of time to go through the ramp-up phase, leveraging a lot of lessons learned as we've gone through the ramp of the R1P, the R1S, the EDV 700 and the EDV 500 over the last 12 months. So those ramps have informed our thinking on making sure that we have as close to a flawless ramp as possible with R2. Now in terms of investment dollars, we're -- one of the things Claire and I spend a lot of time with our -- with the teams on is working very hard to push off payments on some of the CapEx as much as we can. But ultimately, some of these things require us to spend over the course of next year and, of course, into 2024 as well.
Charles Coldicott: Got it. And then on production, so I think to meet your 25,000 target, you need to average about 850 units a week in the final quarter. Can I ask if you've exceeded that rate in any of the weeks so far? Or that a missing component may have impacted production so far? And then maybe along the lines of a prior question, thinking into next year, should we think that quarter-on-quarter growth is kind of linear through next year or will there be some seasonality to that?
RJ Scaringe: The overall -- the way to think about the growth as we look at this both week-over-week, quarter-over-quarter is it's a symphony of not just what we're doing in our plant but also of our supply chain, as you referenced. And looking into 2023, we do see healthy growth quarter-over-quarter. We do have some planned downtime at the end of the year as we make some line improvements and capacity increases across the plant. This is the end of 2023. We've talked about this before. And then in the first quarter of this coming year, and Claire and I both referenced this earlier, we are integrating our Enduro Drive unit and our LFP pack into the EDV platform. And so that's new battery pack, new drive unit, and of course, with that, a host of related changes. So that introduction of a new propulsion platform, which provides considerable cost improvement which we're really excited about, that will take some time. And we've built into the plan for next year really the appropriate time to go through the quality loops and training to make sure that it's a real -- it's a seamless launch.
Charles Coldicott: Perfect. Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas with Canaccord. Your line is open.
George Gianarikas: Good afternoon and thanks for taking my question. Just quickly, you recently had a recall and I'm curious if you could share your thoughts on how your service department performed and how you see those facilities and personnel ramping over the next 12 months?
RJ Scaringe: Thanks, George. Just as a point of background, we had a recall for a torque fastener in one of our suspension components. And it called for inspection and tightening, which the operation takes a couple of minutes on a vehicle. And this was a really remarkable opportunity for us to demonstrate the benefit and the value of a direct service network. So we, today, have completed that operation on 83% of our fleet, with about 10 -- line of sight to another 10% that's currently scheduled. So the speed at which we were able to very rapidly address this across the entire fleet and to do it moments after the decision was made to do this voluntary recall, to have our service leadership immediately working on deploying this and within hours, provide -- performing these first inspections in operations. And then as you just heard me say, within weeks, to have now over 83% of the vehicles complete is really something we're proud of and our customers saw that as well.  The ease at which the process was for customers was great, where we could go to their homes, where we can go to their places of business. In some cases, they would come into service locations, but we tried to make it as seamless as possible. And ultimately, I think the transparency in which we handled the situation was appreciated by our customers.
George Gianarikas: Thanks. And just if I could ask one more. There's been some recent high-profile missteps in autonomy. And one of your competitors stated that it may not be critical for them to develop that technology in-house. I'm just curious as whether your view has been updated on that and whether you think it's critical to have your autonomous offering developed in-house.
RJ Scaringe: Yes. There's a -- within the autonomous space, there's a broad spectrum of ways to approach it. And I'd say to oversimplify, you have very hardware-heavy systems where a vehicle have $100-plus thousand worth of sensor set and compute. And then you have more hardware constrained systems that are designed to be deployed on vehicles that are purchased by customers where you have thousands of dollars of sense unit compute. And our approach is to focus on the latter, where we're developing an in-house autonomous platform that will grow in capability but using a more constrained set of sensors, in our case, a very camera-heavy and radar-heavy platform. And so this is something that we do believe is really important as we talk about not just highway assist features but growing above and beyond what we see today in the Level 2 space. And this takes time but it certainly benefits from having a very large deployed fleet with vehicles that are driving many millions of miles. As of today, our vehicles have driven over 92.5 million miles, which is great, but all those miles contribute to great learning opportunities to build and grow this platform.
George Gianarikas: Thank you.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Emmanuel Rosner: Thank you very much. First, a quick question around how do we think about some of the units and company economics going forward. So I guess in the quarter, you've had quite a bit of an improvement in cash, R& D and SG&A type of spending. Do you view these as a new run rate that is sustainable or especially as volume increases? Or how should we think about it? And then at the unit level, obviously, nice to see the improvement in, I guess, the gross losses. What would be sort of like the reflect the run rate, production rate or cadence that you need to achieve to sort of essentially shrink these losses and bring that more into a positive territory as we look at it?
Claire McDonough: Thanks, Emmanuel. First off, as you noted, we're really encouraged with the progress that we've made to prudently manage our operating expenses across the board, and you're seeing that now through the performance in our Q3 OpEx itself. As it pertains to more so of the baseline, our expectation is from an R&D perspective, that those R&D expenses will increase in Q4 relative to the level of spend in Q3. And that's largely the result of a lot of the development work that is underway for the introduction of our LFP pack and Enduro Drive unit in the commercial van program itself. So there's a lot of development builds that are happening in the backdrop that will contribute to that overall increase in R&D that we expect to see in Q4. But we do expect to continue to manage our OpEx spend in aggregate as we're driving a lot of capital efficiency, while at the same time, we're investing heavily in the customer experience. So on an ongoing basis, we're continuing to open up additional service centers and our charging network, things of that nature, which contributes to that overall SG&A balance for us but also driving incredible efficiency across every dimension in our control as we're scaling the business on a go-forward basis as well. And then to answer the second question you had on unit economics and what that looks like on a go-forward basis, I think one of the pieces that's most important to first understand is today, as you look at our cost of goods sold, the majority of that COGS per unit is really fixed costs within the business. And so the biggest lever we have is really focused on our ramp from a production perspective.  So maybe one thing that I think would be helpful is really providing you guidance as it pertains to the core inputs and drivers as we take our gross margins from current state to the path to positive unit economics in 2024. And as we've talked about in the past, we expect to see a material step change in gross margin in that walk from current state to that 2024-time frame. And the biggest lever, not surprisingly, is really that fixed cost leverage as well as our opportunity to move beyond some of the start-up-related costs that you heard RJ and myself talk a bit about that we've already seen from a progress perspective, Q3 versus Q2. That reflects about two-thirds of the margin walk. So just wanted to make sure that you had a sense for just the magnitude of how important ramp is from an overall unit economic perspective. The second key driver for us is associated with pricing. As we've talked about in the past, the post-March 1 configured preorders that we have in our order book reflect a $93, 000 average ASP. And we've got a lot of really exciting next-generation technologies that will be coming into the fold as well that allows us to believe that, that ASP could even drive meaningfully higher on a go-forward basis as well. So that's the second core lever in that economic walk. And then finally, last but certainly not least, is really all of the core focus and work that we're doing right now around the reduction of our bill of materials. So importantly, the engineering and design changes and the road map we have in place to drive meaningful cost savings within that bill of materials over the next couple of years.  And then finally, all of the work that our procurement teams are doing around commercial cost-down opportunities as we continue to scale the business and importantly, work hand-in-hand with our supply chain partners and as Rivian continues to grow out its own manufacturing capacity and drive better unit economics for the business.
Emmanuel Rosner: That's incredibly detailed and helpful. Can I just ask a quick clarification on this and then I have a question on free cash flow? But the fact that you're, I guess, facing these targets and walk on 2024, does that correspond or match with the specifics of that unit number where you think that these economics essentially work with the volume is at the right place. So I guess what happens in between, I guess?
Claire McDonough: We'll continue to see ongoing performance and improvement as we scale, especially given the magnitude of how important ramp is across the board. And so the important piece here is that in 2024, you see each of these key levers really in place as it pertains to production ramp, as it pertains to Rivian moving to those post-March 1 preorder base, and importantly, as you think about the composition of a lot of the engineering design changes that we have from a road map perspective, that all come together to drive that meaningful step change in gross profit.
Emmanuel Rosner: Okay, that's clear. And then on the free cash flow side, so with some of the efficiencies in CapEx this year but also some of it being, I think, timing into next year, how should we think about CapEx going forward? I think your previous view was maybe low $2 billion year in, year out. Should 2023 be ahead of this as a result of some of these movements?
Claire McDonough: We still expect that CapEx should be in that low $2 billion area as well, even despite the fact that there will be some push of CapEx spend from 2022 to 2023.
Emmanuel Rosner: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.
Colin Langan: Thanks for taking my question. IRA was pretty new after the -- when you last reported. Just trying to get your latest thoughts. You mentioned LFP and that's sort of hitting early next year. There's a little uncertainty around how that might impact LFP insomuch as sort of from check suppliers and the rules are pretty tough there. Do you still think LFP makes sense longer term? And also on the commercial credit side, I mean, how does that work with some of your customers? Are they going to capture most of the credit benefit or are you able to kind of get some of that back to your margin?
RJ Scaringe: With regards to LFP, this is a cell, just to speak to it probably as a chemistry, it works really well in vehicles that require high cycle life, so vehicles that see lots of charge/discharge cycles relative to a high nickel cell. And so commercial applications are really a perfect application from a cycle life point of view. Further, the lower volumetric energy density associated with an LFP cell fits nicely into a vehicle that's physically large because you have the space to fit the pack to achieve enough energy storage but to do it in a slightly larger space. So we're quite bullish on LFP. And interestingly, with regards to IRA, there's not a stringent requirement for commercial applications of source to cell. And so this is really important. So the $7, 500 credit for low GVW commercial vehicles, low gross vehicle weight commercial vehicles stands regardless of source of cell. And as we talked about in the last call, the size of those incentives grow as you move into higher gross vehicle weight classes. Now the second thing I'd point out is we also do believe that the supply chain will evolve. The inherent benefits I referenced at a high level of an LFP chemistry for high cycle life applications are real. There are meaningful advantages. And so we see a lot of opportunity to make sure there's a domestic supply chain for both the production of LFP cells but also for the cathode active material as well as some of the other precursor materials. Above and beyond that, of course, by the nature of an LFP cell, you remove nickel and you remove cobalt, so from an IRA compliance point of view, it's actually an easier chemistry to achieve compliance on, notwithstanding the fact that there's not, as you already pointed out, LFP supply chains for building the cells in the U.S. today. But certainly, from a raw material supply point of view, it is an easier cell long term to maintain that compliance.
Colin Langan: And on the commercial credits, I mean, do you think your customers will get that benefit? Because I'm not sure some of us think I feel like there might have been cost-plus arrangements for some of the vehicles.
RJ Scaringe: Do we believe the -- our customers, specifically, our large commercial customer that we're launching our commercial business with will achieve some of those credits. There's also credits that are manufacturer-facing with IRA. So we're very cognizant of managing both sides of those credits, both the consumer or the customer-facing as well as the manufacturer-facing.
Colin Langan: Got it. And just last question. On the joint venture with Mercedes, how does the production split work? Is there a fixed amount? Because I mean, is there any concern because Mercedes obviously has an established footprint there. So is it just sort of you each have an allocation of production? Or if there's demand, you could take over most of the production? How does that sort of work in the agreement?
RJ Scaringe: At this point, we're still working through a lot of the specifics of our agreement. We've signed and announced an MOU around this joint venture, but there's still a lot of work to be done in terms of defining exactly how it will work.
Colin Langan: Okay. Thanks for taking my question. 
Operator: Our final question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Ryan Brinkman: Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe just a couple around the planned increase in production here in 4Q. I think squeezing from your reiterated full year outlook, it implies about a 45% sequential growth on top of 3Q's, I think, 67% improvement. So firstly, you mentioned being short a specific component in 3Q. Are you able to share what that component is or if you've cycled past that shortage? And what has been your experience so far here in 4Q in the first 5 weeks of the quarter, et cetera, maybe with regards to the second shift, too?
RJ Scaringe: Ryan, we've talked about before just the improvement we're seeing broadly within the supply chain, in particular, relative to the first half of this year, which we've spent some time talking about just how challenging that was. So that improvement, we're absolutely seeing and continue to see. But with a vehicle that has hundreds of suppliers and thousands of components coming from suppliers, it only takes 1 part from 1 supplier to stop the line. And as Claire referenced earlier, we had 5 days we lost already this quarter because of a single component supply shortage. Now that component and the supplier of that component is something we spent a lot of time working really closely with them to avoid having this happen again and have built robust contingencies to manage this risk going forward. And we do believe that there's going to continue to be challenges certainly with supply chain, but we do believe with this specific instance that we've settled it to allow us to continue to ramping without those types of interruptions.
Ryan Brinkman: Okay, very helpful. And then just lastly, I think last quarter, you had talked about preserving free cash outlook by deferring some CapEx spending that was discretionary into next year. Now with the pushout of the R2 a bit, how are you’re thinking about that? Are you maybe looking to trim capital expenditures next year relative to what might have otherwise been the plan?
Claire McDonough: As you heard, we both took down our guidance from a CapEx perspective this year. And so part of that is a shift into next year. And then next year does have some incremental benefit in that we're not spending at the same capacity towards the plant build-out in Georgia. But in aggregate, as I mentioned, we still expect to be in that low $2 billion area even with those movements.
Ryan Brinkman: Okay, very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: I would now like to turn the call back over to RJ for closing remarks.
RJ Scaringe: Thanks, everybody, for joining the call. It was great to have such a broad spectrum of questions here today. Just to reiterate some of the points Claire and I both made throughout the call, we're really looking forward to the continued ramp of our production line. The impact this has not only on the economics of our business but very importantly on ensuring we deliver to customers, excited customers that help us to bring them their vehicles, get them in their R1T, their R1S as soon as possible, that's a critical focus for us. And as we look out into 2023, the continued ramp and continued growth in deliveries is our core, core focus. And with that, of course, driving efficiency into and across the business, not just on our cost of goods sold but across our operating expenses as well as how we deploy capital from a CapEx point of view. So with that, thank you, everybody, for joining, and we look forward to our next earnings call.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."
2757,TSLA,4,2022,2023-01-25 19:33:01,"Martin Viecha: Good afternoon everyone and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2022 Q&A Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3:00 P.M. Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the Q&A session portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue.  But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?
Elon Musk: Thank you, Martin. So 2022 -- just going through the 2022 recap. It was a fantastic year for Tesla. It was our best year ever on every level. Team did an amazing job. It's an honor, of course, to work with such an incredibly talented group of people. So, in 2022, we delivered over 1.3 million cars and achieved a 17% operating margin, the highest among any volume carmaker, I think maybe among any carmaker. While doing so, we generated $12.5 billion in net income and $7.5 billion in free cash flow. Importantly, the Tesla team achieved these records, despite the fact that 2022 was an incredibly challenging year due to forced shutdowns, very high interest rates, and many delivery challenges. So, it's worth noting that all these records were in the phase of massive difficulties. [Indiscernible] credit to the team for achieving that. The most common question we've been getting from investors is about demand. Thus far -- so I want to put that concern to rest. Thus far in January, we've seen the strongest orders year-to-date than ever in our history. We currently are seeing orders at almost twice the rate of production. So it’s hard to say that will continue twice the rate of production, but the orders are high. And we've actually raised the Model Y price a little bit in response to that. So, we don’t -- we think demand will be good despite probably a contraction in the automotive market as a whole. So, basically, price really matters. I think there's just a vast number of people that wanted to buy a Tesla car, but can't afford it. And so these price changes really make a difference for the average consumer. It’s sometimes for those -- for people who are well -- who have a lot of money, they sort of forget about how important affordability is. And it's always been our goal at Tesla to make cars that are affordable to as many people as possible, so I'm glad that we're able to do so. And yes, so I think it's a good thing, all things considered. We're also making very good progress on cost control and we're seeing the cost production in Berlin and Austin drop commensurate with the growth in production, as you'd expect, so yeah. With respect to Autopilot, as of now, we deployed full-self driving beta for city streets to roughly 400,000 customers in North America. This is a huge milestone for autonomy as FSD Beta is the only way any consumer can actually test the latest AI-powered autonomy. And we're currently at about 100 million miles of FSD outside of highways. And our published data shows that improvement in safety system -- stuttering here, safety statistics, it's very clear. So we would not have released the FSD Beta if the safety statistics were not excellent. Regarding batteries, production rate of 4680 cells reached 1,000 cars a week at the end of last year, and we're increasing capacity for 4680 cells by another 100 gigawatt-hours as announced at Giga Nevada yesterday. Our long-term goal is to get to well in excess of 1,000 gigawatt-hours of cells produced internally and continue to use the self cell providers. So to be clear, we will continue to use other cell providers. Just that the demand for lithium ion batteries is quasi-infinite and will be for quite some time. So we feel we can scale a lot faster using both suppliers and internally produced cells. And we've got an amazing plan for making the 4680 cell low-cost and high energy density. So, energy storage also saw record growth and that is continuing to accelerate. That's always worth remembering that the three pillars of a sustainable energy future are obviously electric vehicles, solar and wind, and then the third key item is stationary storage to store the energy from solar and wind because obviously, the sun doesn't shine all the time and the wind doesn't blow all the time. So you have those three things, you can convert all of it to a fully sustainable situation many times over, actually. So, I would like to just make it clear that there is a path to a fully sustainable future for humanity, and our goal at Tesla is to accelerate progress on that path as much as humanly possible. So yeah, so we were obviously ramping up Megapack production. And we expect it to grow at a rate quite a bit faster than our - the goal output. So in conclusion, we are taking a view that we want to keep making and selling as many cars as we can. We believe we can keep pushing for strong volume growth while retaining the industry's best operating margins. As we mentioned many times before, we want to be the best manufacturer. But really, manufacturing technology will be our most important long-term strength. And we'll talk more about our upcoming plans at the March 1st Investor Day. And lastly, I want to once again thank all of our employees for delivering another record-breaking year. Congratulations, guys.
Martin Viecha: Thanks, Elon. And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. Thanks, Martin. So as Elon mentioned, 2022 was a terrific year for Tesla. I also want to congratulate the Tesla team and also say thank you to our suppliers for your support during quite a volatile year. On a full year basis: revenue increased over 50%, operating income doubled, free cash flows increased over 50%, and our margins remained industry-leading. Additionally, we continued to make progress on overhead efficiencies as non-GAAP OpEx as a percentage of revenue improved further. For Q4 specifically, sequential and annual margin was impacted by ASP reductions, as we are managing through COVID impacts in China, uncertainty around the consumer tax credit in the U.S., and a rising interest rate environment. Note that in 2022, rising interest rates alone had effectively increased the price of our cars in the U.S. by nearly 10%. Additionally, COGS per unit has increased on a year-over-year basis, driven primarily by three factors. First is raw materials and inflation led by lithium prices and discussed at length in previous calls. Second, we are working through the early ramp of inefficiencies of our Austin and Berlin and in-house cell production factories. Third, our vehicle mix over the last year has moved more heavily towards Model Y, which carries a slight cost premium to Model 3. Partially offsetting these impacts, we've continued to execute on Tesla controllable cost reductions, in line with the progress we've made in prior years. These improvements include our continued work to gradually move towards a regionally balanced build of vehicles. The Energy business had its strongest year yet across all metrics, led by steady improvement in both retail and commercial storage. While much work remains to grow this business and improve costs, we believe we are on a good trajectory. As we look towards 2023, we are moving forward aggressively leveraging our strength and cost. There are three key points I wanted to make here. First, on demand, as Elon mentioned, customer interest in our products remains high. Second, on cost reduction, we're holding steady on our plans to rapidly increase volume, while improving overhead efficiency, which is the most effective method to retain strength in our operating margins. In particular, we're accelerating improvements in our new factories in Austin, Berlin and in-house cells, where efficiencies are the highest. But we are attacking every other area of cost and unwinding cost increases created for multiple years of COVID-related instability. This includes logistics, expedites, accumulation of material buffers, part premiums, productivity and overheads as an example. As the world transitions from an inflationary to deflationary environment, we expect a strong partnership with our suppliers on this journey as well. In that, we've priced our products with a view towards a longer-term cost structure. Thus, there will be an impact on operating margin in the near term. However, we believe our margins will remain healthy and industry-leading over the course of the year. Third, we are continuing to ensure funding is prioritized for our long-term road map. This includes expanding in-house cell production, bringing Cybertruck to market, development of our next-generation vehicle platform, expansion of our manufacturing footprint and growth of the energy business. We're looking forward to discussing these plans in more detail on our Investor Day in a month. Thank you.
A - Martin Viecha: Thank you very much, Zach. Let's now go to investor questions. The first question is, some analysts are claiming that Tesla orders, net of cancellations, came in at a rate less than half of production in the fourth quarter. This has raised demand concerns. Can you elaborate on order trends so far this year and how they compare to current production rates? I think…
Elon Musk : We already answered that question.
Martin Viecha: Yes, exactly.
Elon Musk : Demand far exceeds production, and we actually are making some small price increases as a result.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The second question is in a similar vein. What has the initial reaction been to global price reductions in early 1Q 2023, specifically in terms of order intake levels? We've answered that one as well. So let's go to the next one. The next investor question is, will Tesla be able to take full advantage of advanced manufacturing production credits for battery cells packs? So $3,700 per long-range Model 3 and Model Y, it's $45 a kilowatt-hour for autos and energy products and how much does Tesla expect to earn in the coming year from these credits?
Elon Musk: I'll say a little bit about it, then I think Zach will add some. Long term, we expect these -- the value of these credits to be very significant. You can do the math if we were to get anyone your 1,000 gigawatt-hours a year of production or even a few hundred gigawatt-hours, it's very significant. So -- but the credits do rely upon domestic manufacturing. And in the case of Panasonic domestic manufacturing, we're splitting the value of the credits. So it -- the value of credits this year will not be gigantic, but I think it could be gigantic -- we think it probably will be very significant in the future.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes, just to add and input some boundaries on what we're expecting in terms of impact to Tesla for this year. So different products, we think, will get different amounts of credit. The regulations here are still influx and there continues to be updates so this is just our best understanding at the moment. But we think on the order of $150 million to $250 million per quarter this year and growing over the course of the year as our volumes grow. And part of the work we're doing here, which is part of what this incentive package is trying to incentivize is, as Elon mentioned, to move more manufacturing onshore in the United States, which is Tesla's plans anyways. And so I think we're pretty well positioned over the coming years to take advantage of this. But then also part of what the goal of this incentive package is, is to improve adoption from our customers. And so we also want to use these incentives to improve affordability as we think about what the price points are in our products going forward. And so as we're thinking about our pricing changes in the US, a couple of weeks ago that we announced, we were looking at what the credit benefit to Tesla would be to make sure that customers are able to receive the benefit not only from this that were received to some extent but also on the consumer-facing side, which is currently $7,500 per car of tax credit, assuming that -- subject to the MSRP caps and the income caps. So we want to use this to accelerate sustainable energy, which is our mission and also the goal of this bill.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. The next question from investors is, after recent price cuts, analyst released expectations that Tesla automotive gross margin, excluding leasing and credits, will drop below 20% and average selling price around $47,000 across all models. Where do you see average selling price and gross margins after the price cuts?
Elon Musk: Yes, go ahead, Zach.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yeah, I'll jump in on this. So there is certainly a lot of uncertainty about how the year will unfold, but I'll share what's in our current forecast for a moment. So based upon these metrics here, we believe that we'll be above both of the metrics that are stated in the question, so 20% automotive gross margin, excluding leases and rent credits and then $47,000 ASP across all models. And so two other comments I want to make on this. Just tactically on sequential ASP changes from Q4 to Q1. And just as a reminder, the ASP reduction is not as large as the reduction in configurator prices. As in Q4, we had backlog customers that we're delivering cars to at a lower price book, given that backlogs had been so long for so much of 2022. But then also, there are various programs in place that we used in Q4 that lowered ASPs. The second comment I wanted to make here is that as a management team here, we're most focused on what our operating margin is. And so as other areas of the business become more important, particularly the energy business, which is growing faster than the vehicle business and as we're heavily focused on operating leverage here, improving efficiency of our overheads, we think the right metric for us to be focused on is operating margin. And so I wanted to make sure that I shared that with the investor community as well, because that is what we're primarily managing to now.
Elon Musk: Yes. Something that I think some of these smart retail investors understand, but I think a lot of others maybe don't is that the -- every time we sell a car, it has the ability, just from uploading software to have full self-driving enabled and full self-driving is obviously getting better very rapidly. So that's actually a tremendous upside potential because all of those cars, with a few exceptions -- I mean, only a small percentage of cars don't have Hardware 3. So that means that there's millions of cars were full self-driving can be sold at essentially 100% gross margin. And the value of it grows as the autonomous capability grows. And then when it becomes fully autonomous, that is a value increase in the fleet. That might be the biggest asset value increase of anything in history. Yeah.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to the next investor question. Since Elon started political influencing, polls from Morning Consult and YouGov show…
Elon Musk: YouGov, crush that with your left.
Martin Viecha: …show Tesla brand favorability declining in 2022 and division among partisan lines. Such brand damage can impact demand. Does Tesla track favorability? And how will any brand image be mitigated?
Elon Musk: Well, let me check my Twitter account. Okay, so I've got 127 million followers. It continues to grow very rapidly. That suggests that I'm reasonably popular. It might not be popular the way with some people, but for the vast majority of people, my follow count speaks for itself. I'm the most interactive account, social media account, I think, maybe in the world, certainly on Twitter, and that's actually predated the Twitter acquisition. So I think Twitter is actually an incredibly powerful tool for driving demand for Tesla. And I would really encourage companies out there of all kinds, automotive or otherwise, to make more use of Twitter and to use their Twitter accounts in ways that are interesting and informative, entertaining, and it will help them drive sales just as it has with Tesla. So the net value of Twitter, apart from a few people are complaining, is gigantic, obviously.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to the next question. Please provide a detailed explanation of where you are on the 4680 ramp. What are the current roadblocks? And when do you expect to scale to 10,000 vehicles a year -- a week?
Andrew Baglino: Yeah. Thanks, Martin. First, I just want to say congrats and thanks to the Tesla 4680 team for achieving 1,000 a week in Q4. It was no small feat. Definitely a result of more than a couple of years of hard work. As far as where we stand in Texas, one of four lines are in production, with the remaining three in stages of commissioning and install. Really, our 2023 goal as a 4680 team is to deliver a cost-effective ramp of 4680s well ahead of Cybertruck. Focus areas are dialing in and improving the quality of the high-volume supply mechanical parts and driving factory process yields up as much as possible. Between two of those things, if we had achieved those key goals, we'll be well set up to -- for a major 4680 year in 2024.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Next investor question is Elon said previously that FSD Hardware 4 will most likely come first in Cybertruck. Is that still the current plan? Do you expect there to be an upgrade path for Hardware 3 cars to Hardware 4?
Elon Musk: Yes, Cybertruck will have Hardware 4. And to be clear, for 2023, Cybertruck will not be a significant contributor to the bottom line but it will be into next year. So it's an incredible product. I can't wait to drive it personally. It will be the car that I drive every day. I actually just I'm wearing the T-shirt with this matched glass. And it's just one of those products that only comes along once in a while, and it's really special. So yeah, so with respect to upgrading cars on Hardware 3, I don't think that will be needed. Hardware 3 will not be as good as Hardware 4, but I'm confident that Hardware 3 will so far exceed the average -- the safety of the average human. So what we're aiming for is like how do we get ultimately to, let's say, for argument's sake if Hardware 3 can be, say, 200% or 300% safer than human, Hardware 4 might be 500% or 600%. It will be Hardware 5 beyond that. But what really matters is are we improving the average safety on the road. But it is the cost and difficulty of retrofitting Hardware 3 with Hardware 4 is quite significant. So it would not be, I think, economically feasible to do so.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is for Zach. Zach, when do you think Tesla Insurance will become big enough revenue source to warrant providing more details in the financials of the business so investors can compare it to other insurance companies?
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. I think it's probably going to take some time before this business is large enough for specific financial disclosures. But I'm happy to provide an update on where we stand in the business. So, we're currently at a $300 million annual premium run rate as of the end of last year. We're growing 20% a quarter, so it's growing faster than the growth in our vehicle business. And in the states in which we're operating, on average, 17% of the customers in the states are using a Tesla Insurance product. And that number continues to tick up as we spend more time in markets. And we see most of the adoption occurring when folks take delivery of a new car, as they're setting up insurance for the first time as opposed to going back and switching when they already have insurance set up. So there's an inherent stickiness in the Insurance business.
Elon Musk: No, go ahead.
Zachary Kirkhorn: No, I was just going to say, just as a broader reminder on kind of the motivation for starting this business, it was to improve and still is to improve the total cost of ownership of our cars, given that we're seeing high premiums of insurance from third-party companies. And that remains our priority here. We'll obviously run this as a healthy business, but we want to make sure we keep our costs low and insurance stays affordable to our customers.
Elon Musk: Yes. And so there are two really important side benefit to our Tesla Insurance that are worth mentioning, one of which Zach alluded to, which is that, just by Tesla operating insurance for our cars at a competitive rate, that makes the other car insurance companies offer better rates for Teslas. So it has a bigger effect than you think because it improves total cost of insurance costs even when they don't use Tesla Insurance, because now the guy [ph] goes up to the world have to compete with Tesla and cannot charge outrageous insurance for Teslas. So it's great. So it has an amplified effect, very important. Then, it is also giving us a good feedback loop into minimizing the cost of repair of Teslas, for all Teslas worldwide, because we obviously want to minimize the cost of repairing at Tesla if it's in a collision and for Tesla Insurance. And previously, we didn't actually have good insight into that, because the other insurance companies would cover the cost. And actually, the cost in some cases, were unreasonably high. So we've actually adjusted the design of the car and made changes in the software of the car to minimize the cost of repair, obviously minimize -- first, the best repair is no repair, avoid the accident entirely, which since every Tesla comes with the most advanced active safety in the world, whether or not you buy full self-driving, you still get the intelligence of full self-driving or active safety, active collision prevention. So it's giving us this really good feedback before, again, reducing cost -- total cost of ownership and also just figuring out how to get -- if somebody's cars in an accident, most accidents are actually small. They're like a broken fender or scratched side of the car or something like, the vast majority of accidents. But we're actually solving how to get somebody's car repaired very quickly and efficiently and back in their hands. And like I said, those improvements actually apply then to old cars. And we're making just to emphasize another key point, because some of these points might be like, so I apologize for being repetitive. But it's remarkable how small changes in design of the bumper and improving -- obviously improving the logistics of spare part or providing spare parts needed for collision repair, have an enormous effect on the repair cost. So, if you're waiting for a part to get repaired and that part takes a month, now you've got a month of having to rent another car. It's extremely expensive. And of course, you're missing the car that you love and the one you actually want to drive. So, this has actually a very significant effect on total cost of ownership and customer happiness.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question from investors is, is Cybertruck production still on track for mid-year?
Elon Musk: We do expect production to start, I don't know, maybe sometime this summer. But, I always like credit downplay at the start of production, because the start of production is always very slow. It increases exponentially, but it's always very slow at first. So I wouldn't put too much stock in start of production. It's kind of when does volume production actually happen, and that's next year.
Andrew Baglino: Thank you. That's great Elon. Like just to emphasize on that, we've started installation of production equipment here in Giga Texas, castings, GA, general assembly, body shops. We built all our beta vehicles, some more coming still in the next month, but as you said the ramp will really come 2024.
Elon Musk: Yes, exactly.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. And the last investor question is, with near-infinite global demand for energy storage.
Elon Musk: Yes.
Martin Viecha: Where will Tesla build the next Megapack factories? How many are needed on each continent?
Elon Musk: It's a good question. It's not something we -- I think we'll provide an update about that in the future, but it is something we're thinking about very carefully. I really kind of like what is the fastest path to 1,000-gigawatt-hours a year of production. And you'll see announcements come out later this year and next, that answer that question.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Okay. And now let's go to analyst questions. The first analyst question comes from Rod Lache from Wolfe Research. And Rod, feel free to unmute your mic.
Rod Lache: I think I’m unmuted. Can you hear me?
Martin Viecha: Yes. We can.
Rod Lache: Okay. Thank you. Just firstly, it sounds like your 1.8 million unit volume indication for this year is somewhat more supply constrained than demand constrained. Then I have a follow-up on cost. Is that an accurate statement?
Elon Musk: Well, okay. I mean, our internal production potential is actually closer to two million vehicles, but we were saying 1.8 million, because -- I don't know, it just always seems to be some force majeure thing that happened somewhere on earth. And we don't control if there's like earthquakes, tsunamis, wars, pandemics, et cetera. So, if it's a smooth year, actually, without some big supply chain interruption or massive problem, we actually have the potential to do 2 million cars this year. We're not committing to that, but I'm just saying that's the potential. So – and I think there would be demand for that, too.
Rod Lache: Yeah. Thanks for clarifying that. And on the cost side, the numbers that we just saw from you, as you pointed out, were weighed down by the 4680 ramp, the Berlin, Austin, Giga castings, processes, not at rate. Can you give us a bit of an indication of the headwind that you're absorbing from those things like you did last quarter? And then lastly, on cost, do you think that we can tease out an interesting data point from on where battery costs are headed from this announcement that you just made last night? If I'm correct, it looks like the investment cost per kilowatt-hour is less than half of what I've seen anywhere else, maybe $30 a kilowatt-hour for that capacity?
Elon Musk: I don't think we want to say the specific number, but it's interesting, if you look at the size of the – of Giga Nevada that is allocated to make 100 gigawatt-hours, is a small fraction of the size that currently makes about 35.
Andrew Baglino: Yes. I mean, the goals we've outlaid at Battery Day on using the investment required to deploy cell manufacturing, I mean, that's been a key focus of ours and the team is doing a good job hitting the marks on that focus.
Elon Musk: Yeah. And it goes back to the point, I was making. I said, it several years ago, I think Tesla's really the competitive strength that will be, by far, the hardest for other companies to replicate is Tesla being just damn good at manufacturing and having the most advanced manufacturing technology in the world. And if you've got that sort of advanced manufacturing toolbox, you can apply it to many things and we're applying it now to battery cells. I should also say that, there – we have other products in development. We're not going to announce them obviously, but they're very exciting. And I think we'll work for those clients when they – when we reveal them. Tesla has the most exciting product of any company on Earth by a long shot. And we'll continue to, I think, be in that position. We've got more great ideas. I mean, we know what to do with. So the future is very exciting. As I said in the last call, there's going to be bumps along the way and we'll probably have a pretty difficult recession this year, probably. I hope not, but probably. And so, one can't predict the short-term sort of stock value, because when there's a recession and people panic and the stock market then prices of stocks, worth value of stocks can drop sometimes to surprisingly low levels. But long term, I'm convinced that, Tesla will be the most valuable company on Earth.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. And I think, Zach, there was a question on cost headwind in Q4.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yeah. I mean, our weighted average COGS for the company, if you were to assume Austin and Berlin were at the cost structure of our other factories, it was on the order of 2,000 to 2,500 of headwinds. So I think from there, you can back into margin impact of those factories as of end of Q4.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. And let's go to the next question from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research.
Pierre Ferragu: Thanks, Martin. Can you hear me well?
Martin Viecha: Yes.
Pierre Ferragu: Excellent. Zach, actually, I'd like to follow up on the data point you just gave on cost. If I look back at the COGS per car, you guys bottom close to $36,000 in the middle of 2021. And then the number went up as you had to face with inflation in input costs and the ramp of Berlin and Texas. And this quarter, I think we are close to $40,000 and we peaked maybe close to $42,000 at some point last year. And so my question from here is, how much time do you think it takes you to get back to this kind of $36,000, which would mean Berlin and Texas and those input costs, all that stuff is normalizing, is that like -- and that would be like a kind of like a 10% decline in the COGS per car? Is that something we can hope to see this year or is that too optimistic?
Zachary Kirkhorn: The Austin and Berlin ramp inefficiencies in 4680 will make a substantial amount of progress on that over the course of the year, and that's within Tesla's control. We're doing a lot of work on cost reduction outside of that. And we talked about supply chain costs, expedite, logistics, attacking everything. On the raw materials and inflation side, where lithium is the large driver there and this was a meaningful source of cost increase for us, we'll have to see where lithium prices go. And we're not fully exposed to lithium prices, but I think in general, is what we've seen from our forecast here, cost per car of lithium in 2023 will be higher than 2022. So that's a headwind that would have to be overcome to return back to those levels. So, I don't think we'll get there this year, but I think we'll make progress. And we'll continue to find ways to offset these raw material costs that we don't have control over. [Indiscernible] is there anything on that?
Roshan Thomas: Yes. Like on the non-cells raw material, we begin to capture benefits of indexes tapering out, but due to the length of various supply chains, it does take time before this is reflected in our financials. And while alumina is down like 20% year-over-year, steel is about 30% down year-over-year, the global non-cells raw materials market continues to be influenced by geopolitical situations in Europe, high production cost due to labor cost increases and energy spikes and disruptions due to natural disasters like typhoon in Korea four months ago, pandemic lockdowns. So, we believe that meaningful price corrections will ultimately come, but it remains uncertain exactly when. In the meantime, we continue to redesign supply chain to make it more efficient and work with our supplier partners to find more efficiencies, streamline logistics and transportation to reduce costs.
Pierre Ferragu: Excellent. Thank you. And I…
Martin Viecha: Sorry, do you want to go say something?
Andrew Baglino: I was going to say, we're also -- our fleet is starting to mature, the 3, Y fleet. And we're gathering a lot of data out of that fleet to understand how we can sort of bring some margin that we didn't know we had out of the product. So over the course of 2023 on the powertrain side, we're actually going to go after sort of some materials where we're paying for more performance than we need, or we have more content than we need, without impacting reliability at all. And that will actually add up to a pretty significant cost reduction on the powertrain side over the course of 2023. So we're not just sort of relying on supply. We're also doing design actions to bring cost out.
Elon Musk: Yes. My guess is, if there is -- if the recession is a serious one and I think it probably will be, but I hope it isn't, that would lead to meaningful decreases in almost all of our input costs. So we expect to see deflation in our input costs most likely, which would then lead to, yes, better margin. I'm just guessing here. So, this is -- that would be my guess.
Pierre Ferragu: Thank you, so much. So as a quick follow-up, Elon, I was thinking about like FSD, and when you look at like the situation today compared to a year ago, it's -- like the progress has been, like, amazing in the quality of the product, but also its rollout. And so, I was wondering, how much is this like impacting the take rate of FSD today? So do you already see that people are getting more excited by FSD, because they see it around them on 400,000 cars and they see the value of the service already, or is that too early to really see like, to expect like an uptick in the take rate?
Elon Musk: The trend is very strong towards use of FSD. And as you alluded to, with each incremental improvement, the enthusiasm obviously increases. And -- so, I think something that still a lot of people out there don't quite appreciate is that Tesla -- of course say like, Tesla is as much as a software company as a hardware company, but Tesla is really one of the world's leading AI companies. This is kind of a big deal with AI on the software side and on the hardware side. With the Hardware 3 inference computer, still the most efficient inference computer in the world despite being, at this point, five years old from the design point. And Hardware 4 coming and then Hardware 5 beyond that, where there are significant leaps. And the Dojo computer, we expect to be using that operationally at Tesla later this year. And we're seeing just a lot of world-class AI talent join the company. There's also the long-term potential of Optimus where we're able to use our expertise in electric motors and power electronics, batteries and advanced manufacturing to be able to make a humanoid robot that is actually useful and can be made at high volume with exceptional capabilities, because of the -- or robot AI that, where we take the -- because the car is like a robot on four wheels and Optimus is a robot on legs. But the -- as we get closer and closer to solving real-world AI, and we don't see anyone even close to us in achieving this, the value -- I think, you appreciate this and a few others do, but most don't know what I'm talking about. And so -- but it's -- this is the thing that has order of magnitude potential market cap improvement for Tesla.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. And the next question comes from Alex Potter from Piper Sandler.
Alex Potter: Can you hear me, guys?
Martin Viecha: Yes.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes
Alex Potter: Okay, great. So a quick one on FSD. This, I guess, for Zach. Obviously, you unlocked some deferred revenue in the quarter that will translate presumably into higher margins on every incremental sale going forward so long as people opt in for FSD. But was wondering if you're able to disclose the percentage of the $15,000 price that you're not going to be able to recognize as revenue upfront rather than deferred?
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. I mean, the way that we've structured this is a full self-driving package has two components. There's enhanced Autopilot, the price of which is listed on the website. We fully recognize that. Then there's an incremental, which is for the additional features of full self-driving offers and we've released a portion of that. And then there's a minority of the total package that's remaining that will be released over time as software updates are there. And in our shareholder letter, in addition to disclosing the dollar amount of the deferred revenue release, we also included in there the dollar value of the balance of unreleased deferred revenue that will be released over time with future software updates.
Alex Potter: Okay, great. And then maybe 1 additional question here on the incremental capacity in Nevada, the 4680s that you're planning. That's a lot of batteries obviously, and presumably, you won't be putting all of those in Tesla Semi. So I guess, two questions about that incremental capacity. First, is it correct to assume that all of those 4680s are going to be more or less fungible and usable in your entire range of products? And if the answer is yes, then if you had to guess, how do you think that 100 gigawatt-hours would be allocated between your various end markets?
Elon Musk: I don't know, this is a bit too much guessing
Andrew Baglino: Yes.
Elon Musk: But -- yes, Yes. I mean, you're right. Not all of the 100 gigawatt-hours are going to go into the Semi trucks, that is correct. Let's say like -- I alluded to a number of future products. Those future products would use the 4680.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. And the next question comes from George from Canaccord Research.
George Gianarikas: Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. So you recently adjusted prices and that may have put many of your competitors in the back foot. In addition to that, capital markets have recently gotten a lot tougher. So with those factors in mind, I'm curious how you see the current competitive landscape changing over the next few years. And who do you see as your chief competitors five years from now?
Elon Musk: Five years is a long time. As with the Tesla order part, AI team, until late last night and just we're just asking guys like, so who do we think is close to Tesla with -- a general solution for self-driving? And we still don't even know really who would even be a distant second. So, yes, it really seems like we're -- I mean, right now, I don't think you could see a second place with a telescope, at least we can't. So, that wouldn't last forever. So, in five years, I don't know, probably somebody has figured it out. I don't think it's any of the car companies that we're aware of. But I'm just guessing that someone might be right out eventually, so yes.
Zachary Kirkhorn: I mean, beyond that, Elon, like in the vehicle space, even though the market is shrinking, we're growing and EVs have doubled almost year-over-year. So, like it ever keeps up with the trend of EVs is going to be our competitor. The Chinese are scary; we always say that. But like a lot of people always look at the EV market share, but we always look at it is how much of the total vehicle space do we have, and we're just going to keep growing in that space. There's 95% for us to go get.
Elon Musk: Yes. And I don't want to say like -- I think we have a lot of respect for the car companies in China. They are the most competitive in the world, that is our experience and the Chinese market, it is the most competitive. They work the hardest and they work the smartest, that's so for the China car companies that we're competing against. And so we would guess, there are probably some company out of China as the most likely to be second to Tesla. We are -- the Telsa China team is winning in China. And I think we actually are able to attract the best talent in China. So, hopefully, that continues. So, yes, so we're fired about the future and well, it's going to be great.
George Gianarikas: Just as a follow-up, the Inflation Reduction Act has created huge tax incentives for commercial vehicles. You mentioned an incredibly interesting product pipeline. Are there maybe some plans to accelerate commercial vehicle form factors outside of the Tesla Semi to help accelerate EV adoption?
Elon Musk: Well, I was basically saying that, yes, but I'm not going to give you details because this is -- nice try, nice try. Yes, of course, of course. So, we actually look at like, what is the limiting factor for new vehicles because if the -- for the longest time, we've been constrained on total cell lithium-ion production output. And so people said, like, why not bring this other car to market or that other car to market? Well, it doesn't really help if all you're doing is shuffling around the batteries from one car to another. In fact, it hurts because you add complexity, but you don't add incremental volume. So, it's sort of pointless, in fact, like counterproductive to add model complexity without solving the availability of lithium-ion batteries. So, as we get -- so we want new product introduction to match where the cells are available or that new product to use those cells without cannibalizing the cells of the other cars. That's the actual limiting factor for new models, not anything else really.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to the next question. The next question comes from William Stein from Truist.
William Stein: Great. Thanks for taking my question. You started to answer this earlier, but I'd like to ask this question about the AI elements of your business and ask if you could comment on progress around Dojo and Optimus and your anticipation for the likelihood, for example, for the company to disconnect the GPU cluster in favor of Dojo and to have some market achievement an Optimus?
Elon Musk: Yes. I mean, obviously, with -- just we're still at the early stages, there are big [indiscernible] in any predictions. It's like -- I think, easy to predict long-term, but hard to predict the time in between now and then. But it's -- we think Dojo will be competitive with the NVIDIA H1 at the end of this year and then hopefully surpass it next year. And the key there is -- I think what's the energy usage required for a given amount of -- if you're training a frame of video, how -- what's the energy cost required to do that training? And we think probably -- we said this already actually at AI Day, so it's not new information, but we do see potential for an order of magnitude improvement relative to GPU, what GPUs can do for Dojo, which is obviously very specialized for AI training. It's hyper-specialized for AI training. It's not -- wouldn't be great for other things, but it should be extremely good for AI training. So just like if you do an ASIC or something, it's going to be better than a CPU. This is sort of, in some ways, like a giant ASIC. And we're able to -- since we're operating one of the biggest GPU clusters in the world already, the -- we've got a good sense of how efficient the GPU clusters operate and what Dojo needs to do in order to be competitive. But we think that it does have a fundamental architectural advantage because it's designed not to be -- the GPU is trying to do many things for many people. We're trying to do graphics, video games. It's doing crypto mining. It's doing a lot of things. Dojo is just doing one thing and that is training. And we're also optimizing the low-level software too. So it had a various sort of, ground middle level so it's just insanely good at efficient training. And the intra-communication between the Dojo modules is extremely high. It's not going across an Ethernet cable. It's like -- so anyway, the -- we see a path to an order of magnitude improvement in the energy efficiency or per given unit of training. But we also have to achieve that. And so when will it be achieved? It's hard to say, but we do see a path to get there. And then also on inference, like once you've got something trained, well, if you want to have a product that's a consequence of that training, that product may not be anything to do with cars. Then the efficiency of inference is extremely important. And we also have, by far, the most efficient inference computer at the -- with the FSD computer in the car. This has potential for products that are in car even really in automotive.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. And William, do you have a follow-up?
William Stein: Yes. It sounds like the 1.8 million units you expect this year is supply, not demand limited supply, it sounds like by the lithium batteries. If you were to become demand limited, can you talk to us about your propensity to use price and your relatively high industry margins to grow units and share?
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. To be clear, the 1.8 million is not cell supply limited. And I mean, we did address that number earlier in the call if you want to answer.
Elon Musk: Yes. It's roughly -- cell supply is roughly matched with that. And this 1.8 million cars, if we get lucky, it could be more. And then the rest would go into stationary storage, the Powerwall and Megapack. So, yes, so true.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Let's have the final question from Adam Jonas.
Adam Jonas: Hi. Elon, first question is, is it time for Tesla to significantly expand the captive finco? I mean, you only have like $4.5 billion of receivables. It's basically nothing compared to other big auto companies. And then I have a follow-up.
Elon Musk: Zach maybe is best to answer that.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. I mean, the way that we've been using captive financing so far is to plug what we believe to be gaps in the market of existing third-party products. And so we have a couple of offerings in Europe. We do loans for our energy business, retail energy business here in the US. We do leasing and we do a small amount of U.S. loans that are very targeted. And so we're using captives to support market caps, as I mentioned. So basically, it's a vehicle to support vehicle sales, make sure customers have access. I do think there's opportunity here to continue to grow this. We are growing it slowly here. It is a consumer of cash, so we're being cautious on how we do that. But the plumbing is in place to do a lot more here. And I think we'll have to see how things unfold over the course of the year and make decisions real time as to how much we ramp it up versus ramp it back.
Elon Musk: I think if we see a severe recession this year, which like I said, hopefully, we don't, in severe recessions, cash is king big time, because it's in such short supply. So we want to be cautious about using cash for loans and that sort of thing for cars. I feel we're in a very strong position to get through a recession, because we really don't have any debt. And we've got over $20 billion of cash, which is great. The cash is earning a ridiculous return, a good return. So it's like nontrivial. And the interest rate actually in the $20 billion is earning like quite a good amount. And I've made this point on Twitter a few times. I'm sure a lot of people on this call understand the fact -- the basic value of a security is a function of the risk-free rate or we'll see how risk-free it really is but the T-bill rate. So if you've got -- I think the -- I recall correctly, the S&P 500 has a long-term rate of return of roughly 6%. And so I think that needs to be very cautious about having Fed rates that potentially exceeds 6%. Like, if we see deflation, and I think we are seeing deflation then you would add the deflation number to the 'risk-free rate' from the Fed. And as that starts to exceed 6%, now you're starting to exceed the long-term return of the S&P 500 and starts to become questionable as to why don't just put your money in a savings account essentially instead of in the S&P 500, if the S&P 500 is variable and the bank interest rate is not? This is -- so basically, the Fed is the risk of crushing the value of all equities, which is quite a serious, danger.
Adam Jonas: Thanks Elon. And just a follow-up, I don't want to steal thunder from March 1st and in Austin, but how close are we to that step change improvement in BoM cost where you could sell an EV for under $25,000 or $30,000 and actually generate a profit, that kind of real moving assembly line moment in manufacturing? Again, I don't want to steal the thunder but just if you wanted to kind of wrap-up with thoughts there that would be helpful. Thanks Elon.
Elon Musk: I mean, I'd love to answer -- I'll probably be asking the same question, but we would be jumping the gun on future announcements.
Martin Viecha: Fantastic. Thank you very much, everyone, for all your good questions. And we will see you again in three months' time.
Elon Musk: Thank you.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Bye-bye."
2873,ON,4,2022,2023-02-06 12:18:06,"Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the onsemi Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Parag Agarwal, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead.

Our estimates or other forward-looking statements may change, and the company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changed assumptions or other events that may occur except as required by law. Now let me turn it over to Hassane. Hassane?
Hassane El-Khoury : Thank you, Parag, and thank you all for joining us today. 2022 has been an excellent year for onsemi, and nothing makes me prouder than to share our latest progress after closing the second year of our transformation. Our worldwide teams have yet again delivered outstanding results, allowing us to deliver the most successful year in the company's history, with record revenue of $8.3 billion in 2022, an increase of 24% year-over-year, with earnings growing 3x faster than revenue. Our gross margin of 49.2% increased 880 basis points for the full year and 1,650 basis points since we began our transformation journey. From our manufacturing footprint to our product portfolio and go-to-market strategy, we have transformed all facets of our business and set ourselves up to win in the fastest-growing megatrends of the automotive and industrial markets. We earned ourselves a position in the S&P 500 this past year, and we created more value for our shareholders than ever before. The uncertainty in the macro environment has impacted demand, and we have seen a slowdown in some areas of our business, which include consumer, computing and parts of industrial.  Demand for our automotive business remains healthy as automakers have been catching up on production levels. In Q4, our automotive business grew 54% year-over-year, 13% quarter-over-quarter and accounted for 47% of our total revenue as compared to 35% in the quarter a year ago. Our industrial business grew 6% year-over-year in Q4 and accounted for 26% of our total revenue. While we saw softness in parts of our industrial business in Q4, demand for energy infrastructure and medical applications, such as continuous glucose monitors and hearing aids, remain strong.  We continue to extend our leadership in silicon carbide with our customers who value the leading performance of our silicon carbide modules and our end-to-end supply chain capabilities. In 2022, we shipped more than $200 million in silicon carbide revenue. We remain on track to deliver $1 billion in 2023 based on committed revenue from LTSAs, and we now have more than $4.5 billion of committed silicon carbide revenue between 2023 and 2025. By focusing on the areas where we provide the most value to our customers, we have positioned ourselves with the market leaders in the fastest-growing segments in automotive and industrial. The top automotive OEMs are not only choosing onsemi for silicon carbide, but for our worldwide class intelligent power and sensing solution. In automotive, we have seen tremendous momentum with silicon carbide, and we believe that vehicle electrification will be a long-term driver for our business. We expect to remain supply constrained for the next several years even as we aggressively add capacity to our Hudson, Czech Republic and South Korea manufacturing sites. As we recently announced, Volkswagen Group has selected onsemi as a corporate strategic supplier to provide the silicon carbide modules that enable a complete traction inverter solution for its entire fleet of next-generation electric vehicles. onsemi will deliver its EliteSiC 1200-volt traction inverter power modules. These modules facilitate a small footprint and full weight system solution, which will support the front and rear axle inverters in a large range of VW models. We already shipped more than 500 different devices to Volkswagen Group, including IGBTs, MOSFETs, image sensors and power management integrated circuits and this expanded engagement to include our silicon carbide further strengthens our partnership with one of the largest carmakers leading the charge in vehicle electrification. In 2022, we began to recognize revenue at Tesla from silicon carbide shipments and expect revenue to see a continued ramp in 2023. We have also expanded our partnership beyond silicon carbide and image sensor to numerous power and analog solutions, totaling over 300 different part numbers. Jaguar Land Rover signed a seven-year long-term supply agreement to adopt onsemi's silicon carbide for their next- generation platforms and other solutions for their 11-kilowatt onboard chargers and other xEV application. This LTSA also provides Jaguar Land Rover with the supply assurance for their current production model across onsemi's broad portfolio of power solutions. In addition, Hyundai Motor Group selected onsemi's EliteSiC family of silicon carbide power modules for their high-performance electric vehicles. Onsemi's EliteSIC silicon carbide modules increase the efficiency and lower the weight of the traction inverters extending electric vehicle range and improving performance. Our high-power density SiC modules deliver the most innovative package technology to reduce power losses associated with DC to AC conversion, along with reduced size and weight of the traction inverter to extend EV range and increase performance. We remain just as focused on our engagement with Tier 1s, where we are seeing a steep increase in onsemi content for upcoming EV select platforms and advanced safety applications. We recently secured a win with a major Tier 1 for a marquee European platform that includes more than $1,800 of content across our portfolio of silicon carbide and other intelligent power solutions for traction inverters. These are just a few of our recent wins in the fastest-growing automotive applications, giving us confidence in our outlook for this business and our $1 billion revenue year for silicon carbide. As the leading automakers accelerate the transition towards vehicle electrification, increased autonomy and advanced safety, they are choosing onsemi as their preferred partner for the performance of our silicon carbide solutions and vertical integration from substrates to state-of-the-art modules, for our world-class image sensors and for the breadth of our complementary intelligent power intensive portfolio, and for our manufacturing excellence and supply assurance. In industrial, while fourth quarter revenue declined 10% over Q3, we expect our traction in energy infrastructure and medical applications to offset the softness we are seeing in the legacy parts of this business. The global energy crisis is triggering an acceleration in alternative energy deployment with solar as the most installed renewable power capacity by 2027, tripling from 2021. This accelerated deployment trend is reflected in our revenue for energy infrastructure, which increased 75% year-over-year, above our forecast of 60% growth. Our newest 200-kilowatt wins with leading energy storage system suppliers contained nearly $370 of content per system in silicon carbide and other power solutions.  Last month, we announced our partnership with Ampt, the world's #1 DC optimizer company for large-scale solar and energy storage systems. Ampt uses our EliteSiC silicon carbide critical power switching application. Customers like Ampt expect leading-edge technology, and our silicon carbide solution meets the high performance and reliability standards required for these renewable energy applications. In addition to our alternative energy opportunities, our customer LTSAs are providing demand visibility into the broader industrial market where we expect our growth to come from over-the-counter hearing aid and emerging requirements in factory automation. We are at the beginning of a transition cycle where our award-winning inductive position sensors and new generation image sensors engineered for robotics and scanning provide better performance and lower power. We have spent the last two years making structural changes in all areas of the company to improve the resiliency of our business. We are a different company today. We have rationalized our product portfolio and manufacturing footprint, we are leading in the fastest-growing markets, and we are now getting the true value for our products with multiyear commitments from our customers. We will not be distracted with the current market environment and remain focused on our execution against our near-term objectives and our long-term strategy. Our customers are planning well beyond 2023, and they are investing with onsemi to deliver leading-edge technologies that address complex intelligent power and sensing requirements in automotive, industrial and cloud power markets. We will grow faster than the markets we plan. And our traction in silicon carbide, coupled with the demand visibility that long-term supply agreements support us, leave me confident that with a disciplined approach in 2023, we will continue to meet our customers' expectations and deliver on our commitments to our shareholders. Now I will turn the call over to Thad to provide additional details on our financials and guidance. Thad?
Thad Trent : Thanks, Hassane. Let me first start by going through our full year's performance, followed by results for the quarter and wrap up with guidance for the first quarter. As Hassane mentioned, our results have only been possible because of incredible effort of our worldwide teams. I want to thank our employees for embracing our fast-paced transformation and going above and beyond for our customers. A year where the macro environment and geopolitical uncertainties were front and center, we remained steadfast in our execution to achieve a record financial year for onsemi. Our 2022 revenue closed at $8.3 billion, an increase of 24% year-over-year, primarily driven by strength in our automotive and industrial businesses. Our non-GAAP gross margin of 49.2% increased 880 basis points year- over-year, achieving our target model of 48% to 50% for the full year. Our non-GAAP earnings per share was $5.33 compared to $2.95 in 2021, growing 3x faster than revenue. We just closed the eighth quarter since the beginning of our transformation, and our continued success is a direct result of the structural changes we've made to improve the resiliency of our business. The company's transformation has taken shape by optimizing three key areas of our business: our manufacturing footprint, our product portfolio and our go-to-market strategy. In 2022, we divested four subscale fabs to improve our cost structure. We completed the acquisition of East Fishkill fab in New York, which became part of our manufacturing network on December 31. We further reduced price-to-value discrepancies to maximize value for our technology investments. We exited volatile and highly competitive businesses, allowing us to walk away from $294 million of noncore revenue to date at an average gross margin of 26%. We've pivoted our portfolio to high-margin products and end markets with auto and industrial exiting the year at 73% of total revenue versus 59% in Q4 of 2020. We exited the year with $16.6 billion of signed LTSAs across our entire portfolio. We increased our new product revenue by 34%, and we increased the design win funnel by 38% year-over-year. These structural changes have yielded a threefold increase in free cash flow since the start of our transformation, growing approximately 4x as fast as revenue, with 2022 coming at a 20% free cash flow margin. Our strategy has driven radical improvements in the performance of our business units, and these businesses are now best-in-class among their immediate and broader peer group. For example, our Intelligent Sensing Group's transformation has yielded a high growth, high operating margin business. ISG is now comparable to peers who typically command valuation multiples at premiums of more than 2x the industry average. ISG exited Q4 with record gross margin of more than 49%. By rationalizing the portfolio and exiting low-margin consumer- facing markets, ISG's gross margin has improved by more than 1,600 basis points since the start of our transformation and the revenue mix is now more than 90% high-margin automotive and industrial. ISG revenue of $1.28 billion in 2022 increased 73% over 2020, driven by the transition to higher-resolution sensors at elevated ASPs. As I mentioned earlier, we assumed ownership of our 300-millimeter fab in East Fishkill on December 31. This fab is a key enabler of our brownfield manufacturing strategy by providing incremental capacity for our silicon power products that we are transitioning from our fab in Korea to create capacity for our silicon carbide ramp. In addition, the EFK fab provides us with the capabilities to support long-term growth for our intelligent sensor business. Since the acquisition closed on the last day of the year, there is no P&L impact in Q4, but the acquired assets are now reflected on our balance sheet. Turning to results for the fourth quarter. As I mentioned, Q4 was another quarter of strong results. Total revenue was $2.1 billion, an increase of 14% over the fourth quarter of 2021 and a 4% decline in quarter-over-quarter. Record automotive revenue of $989 million increased 13% quarter-over-quarter and 54% year-over-year to 47% of our total revenue as compared to 35% in the quarter a year ago. Industrial revenue grew by 6% year-over-year, but declined by 10% quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to macroeconomic factors. As Hassane mentioned, our energy infrastructure and medical businesses continue to grow despite macroeconomic headwinds. Revenue from intelligent power and intelligent sensing accounted for 69% of our total revenue in Q4. Intelligent power grew 18% year-over-year and intelligent sensing grew by 47% year-over-year, both driven by continued growth in the automotive and industrial markets. Revenue for the Power Solutions Group, or PSG, was $1 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year. Revenue for the Advanced Solutions Group, or ASG, was $701 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year and revenue for the Intelligent Sensing Group, or ISG, was a record $354 million, an impressive increase of 44% year-over-year. GAAP gross margin for the fourth quarter was 48.5% and non-GAAP gross margin was 48.4% and above the midpoint of our guidance. Our non-GAAP gross margin declined by 90 basis points quarter-over-quarter, with our planned ramp in silicon carbide and lower factory utilization at 74% as we proactively slowed wafer starts from the beginning of the year. We also exited an additional $17 million of revenue in the quarter at an average gross margin of 40% bringing the total to date to $294 million of noncore business exits. GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 33.5% and non-GAAP operating margin was 34.1%, an increase of 550 basis points year-over-year and a decrease of 130 basis points quarter-over-quarter. GAAP earnings per diluted share for the fourth quarter was $1.35 as compared to $0.96 in the quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per share was $1.32 as compared to $1.09 in the fourth quarter of 2021. We remain confident in the sustainability of our long-term gross margin model of 48% to 50% despite near-term headwinds from silicon carbide start-up costs and our ramp at EFK. As we enter 2023, we are maintaining tight control of our wafer starts, managing inventory levels, and we remain disciplined in our spending. We expect continued favorability as we plan to exit more than $400 million of low-margin business. And starting in 2024, we'll start recognizing $160 million of gross margin benefit as we transition our wafer supply from the divested fab. Now let me give you some additional numbers for your models. GAAP operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $316 million as compared to $352 million in the fourth quarter of 2021. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $300 million as compared to $306 million in the quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP operating expenses were below the midpoint of our guidance as we proactively manage spend across the company. For the fourth quarter, our non-GAAP tax rate was [15.9%], our GAAP diluted share count was 448 million shares, and our non-GAAP diluted share count was 440 million shares. We repurchased 1.3 million shares for $90 million in the fourth quarter. For the full year, we repurchased 4 million shares for a total of $260 million at an average price of $65.13 per share, which was 16% of 2022 free cash flow. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents increased 19% sequentially to $2.9 billion, and we had $1.5 billion undrawn on our revolver. Cash from operations was $731 million and free cash flow was $380 million or 18.5% of revenue. Capital expenditures during the fourth quarter were $340 million, which equates to a capital intensity of 16% for the quarter and 12% for the full year. As we indicated previously, we are directing a significant portion of our capital expenditures towards silicon carbide and enabling our 300-millimeter capabilities at the East Fishkill fab and expect our capital intensity to be in the mid- to high teens percentage range for the next several quarters. Accounts receivable of $842 million declined by $15 million and DSO of 37 days increased by 1 day. Inventory increased by $41 million sequentially and days of inventory increased by 7 days to 136 days. This includes approximately 26 days of bridge inventory to support fab transition and the impending silicon carbide ramp. We continue to proactively manage distribution inventory, decreasing inventory in the channel by $10 million sequentially and at historically low levels with weeks of inventory at 7.3 weeks compared to 6.9 weeks in Q3. Total debt was $3.2 billion and net leverage is approaching zero. We accrued $15.7 million on our balance sheet under property, plant and equipment related to the 25% investment tax credit for investments in our U.S. factories. This will eventually flow through our income statement as lower depreciation, and we will receive the associated cash benefit in the future. Let me now provide you key elements of our non-GAAP guidance for the first quarter. A table detailing our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance is provided in the press release related to our fourth quarter results. We continue to see strong demand from our automotive end market, driven by electrification and ADAS and accelerating ramp of our silicon carbide business. We continue to see softening in certain industrial applications, and we expect increased weakness in our nonstrategic end markets that we plan to exit. Given the macro uncertainty, we are taking a cautious stance on our guidance. Despite a slowing macroeconomic environment, our business continues to strengthen with total committed revenue under LTSAs of $16.6 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion quarter-over-quarter. We expect to recognize more than $5 billion of revenue from our committed LTSAs in 2023 in addition to our non-cancelable nonreturnable orders. We anticipate Q1 revenue will be in the range of $1.87 billion to $1.97 billion, with continued strength in automotive amid softness in all other end markets. We expect non-GAAP gross margin to decline, to be between 45.7% and 47.7% due to lower factory utilization and the dilutive impact of ramping silicon carbide and EFK, which is within our expected range of 100 basis points to 200 basis points and 50 basis points to 70 basis points, respectively. This also includes share-based compensation of $3.4 million. We expect 2023 to be a transition year for our gross margins as we manage the temporary headwinds.  We expect non-GAAP operating expenses of $298 million to $313 million, including share-based compensation of $23 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP OIE to be $21 million to $25 million. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% and our non-GAAP diluted share count for the first quarter is expected to be approximately 441 million shares. This results in non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $1.02 to $1.14. We expect capital expenditures of $340 million to $380 million, primarily in brownfield investments, which are a more efficient use of capital and the greenfield alternative of building a fab from the ground up. As a company, we become much more agile, controlled and purposeful in our execution, and we'll benefit from our disciplined approach in 2023 and beyond. Given our confidence in our strategy to invest for long-term profitable growth, we remain committed to a balanced capital allocation strategy to drive shareholder value. With a threefold increase in free cash flow, a strong balance sheet and our net leverage approaching zero, we have increased flexibility into one capital towards our shareholder return program. Today, we announced that our Board of Directors has approved a new program authorizing up to $3 billion of share repurchases through 2025, representing twice that of the last authorization, which expired at the end of last year. This is aligned with our stated strategy of returning 50% of free cash flow to shareholders over the long term. And finally, we hope you're saving the date for our Analyst Day in New York on May 16. We look forward to sharing more of our long-term vision at that time. And with that, I would like to turn the call back over to Christa to open the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.
Ross Seymore : First question for either of you guys. In the first quarter, guiding down about 9% sequentially. I know you said auto is staying strong and everything else is kind of softening. Can you give a little bit more color on the puts and takes with exits, et cetera? And then perhaps more importantly, how those trend throughout the year between the end segments within that $5 billion of LTSAs you plan to represent?
Thad Trent : Yes, Ross, this is Thad. So if you look at the planned exits that we have for Q1, we think we'll exit up to another $75 million in the first quarter. As we've always said, this will be market-dependent, but we do kind of see that in the cards here. In terms of overall what we're seeing for Q1, we're looking at automotive continuing to be strong. Think about it as kind of low single digits. We think industrial is down kind of low single digits. And the rest, consumer, compute, other, being down pretty significantly to make up that -- the rest of it to be down approximately 9% for the quarter. I think for the year, it's hard to tell at this point. I think we see auto remains strong. I think industrial kind of being potentially flat year-on-year and the rest of the business being down slightly or down, but it's obviously too early to tell what's going to happen long term.
Ross Seymore : And then on the gross margin side of things, it seems like that's holding in well despite the utilization dropping and all the other headwinds. It doesn't seem like there's any surprises. Any sort of linearity about how the buckets work throughout the year, the exits being a positive, the silicon carbide side and the East Fishkill being negative? Is that something that peaks out in the headwinds in the beginning of the year and then lessen? Or is the shape a little more back-end loaded? Anything you could provide on color on that would be helpful.
Thad Trent : Yes. Look, you know that, right? I mean there's no surprises here on where margins are coming in. We're really happy with where we're performing. All of the ramps in silicon carbide and EFK are playing out just as we would expect. We think these headwinds kind of peaked probably Q2, Q3. We think by the end of this year, we've got silicon carbide, the headwinds there have gotten to parity and the margins for average at that point after all these headwinds are behind us. But we're pretty happy with the performance and the tracking of gross margin at this point, right on track with what we've been telegraphing for a couple of quarters ago.
Operator: And our next question comes from Vivek Arya from Bank of America.
Vivek Arya : I just wanted to dig into the silicon carbide comments. It seemed like you are reaffirming the $1 billion commitment for this year. And I think you raised the longer-term outlook by $0.5 billion to $4.5 billion. I was wondering, Hassane, if you could give us some more color on what's helping to drive that upside? And as kind of part B of that question, how should we think about any incremental headwinds on the cost or the gross margin side as you bring on more internal material supply? Are you getting the yields? Are you getting the performance? Are you getting what you need from your internal supply? Or will you have to rely more on external wafers that could change the profitability of your silicon carbide business?
Hassane El-Khoury : Yes. So, Vivek, two parts of your question. So first, yes, we're reconfirming the $1 billion revenue for '23. The increase of $0.5 billion in the same timeframe, the '23 to '25, obviously, we've always said we continue to engage with customers. Customer continue to value the performance of our products and the end-to-end capability, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks. So that obviously has maintained the strength of our business where customers are committing to long-term supply agreements, even in what I would call a shorter- term horizon, which is '23 to '25. So that's again a testament of where we stand with the technology and the supply. Now as far as your comments on internal substrate, we remain committed to our internal substrates. So of course, we have been -- through '22, we have ramped our capabilities for internal substrates. That ramp is going to keep increasing. And that ramp is as a plan to support our growth in the LTSA that we have from '23 to '25 and even beyond. And as far as yields are concerned, I know there's conversations about yield, none of which have been made by the company. So I'll use the opportunity to set the record straight. Any commentary about yields from unreliable sources, I'm not going to comment on. What I will tell you is our yields are coming in per plan. Our ramp is coming in per plan. And as shown in our margin in the fourth quarter and our guide in the first quarter, which all have come between that 100 basis points to 200 basis points. So our business is healthy, our ramp is on track, and we will continue to invest in browfield to support our customers.
Vivek Arya : Very helpful, Hassane. And then just as a quick follow-up. I was hoping you could give us some color on your automotive business, excluding silicon carbide. Sales have now grown in your auto business for, I believe, 10 quarters, and you're guiding to another quarter of sequential growth. How undersupplied is the automotive market right now? And is your non-silicon carbide business you think can it grow in line or above the market this year?
Hassane El-Khoury : Yes. Look, I think we're going to outgrow the market in automotive. We said that goal even back in our Analyst Day, and we've been outperforming our own goal. Outside of silicon carbide, the breadth of our portfolio is what is really highlighting the strength of that business. We've always said that our growth is going more pact content versus unit sold. Thad talked about the transformation we've had in our image sensing -- our Intelligent Sensing Group. That is content, both in number per vehicle, but also the ASPs with the higher resolution. That's driving growth in our business. A lot of the power, whether it's IGBT or support other medium and high-voltage fabs outside of silicon carbide, that's more content, both content and share gains. I can tell you, I am -- we are winning more share as others can't supply, and we're locking in that share gain in LTSAs to sustain the long term. So all of that is what is giving us the confidence in our ramp. And look, we still are oversubscribed as far as demand is concerned, which puts us in a very good buffer as far as whatever demand does and the macro does. We feel very strongly about the position in our automotive. And of course, other segments from ASG is the LED driver, ultrasonic sensing. All of these are macro trends that are happening in automotive driving our content in that business.
Operator: Our next question comes from Chris Danely from Citi.
Christopher Danely : Last quarter, you gave us an update on the shortage situation and lead times. I think you talked about lead times being 45 weeks, where they're normally 15. How have the shortage situation and lead times changed over the last three months?
Thad Trent : Yes. So the lead times are relatively bottom and think they are down a couple of weeks on average. But when you're out at 45 weeks, that really isn't material. So I would say things have been very consistent throughout the quarter in terms of the lead times as well as just the shortages and the number of escalations that we've seen.
Christopher Danely : Sure. And then any comment on the Q2 outlook? It's been sort of flat, slightly up, slightly down over the last several years. How's Q2 looking? Can we expect this to spread into Q2?
Thad Trent : So Chris, we'll talk about Q2 in 90 days. It's too early to make that call.
Operator: Our next question comes from Toshiya Hari from Goldman Sachs.
Toshiya Hari : Hassane, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about your philosophy around LTSAs with the macro softening. I guess one of the common questions we get from investors is how does the company? How do you guys manage any requests around pushouts and things of that sort? I think in the past, you've talked about not being flexible on the pricing side because that's a committed contract, if you will. But how are you managing the volume side of things as it relates to LTSAs?
Hassane El-Khoury : Yes. Look, obviously, our philosophy has not changed. The pricing is firm. The backdrop is the LTSAs are legally binding. We will engage with customers for the right reasons. Obviously, it's not in anybody's benefit to have inventory on their shelf or even inventory in the channel. So we've been managing the inventory in the channel. You've seen that consistently in our performance. So that philosophy is holding, and we will maintain that. Engagement with customers, it's not about price, but we will have a win-win situation with the customer, and that remains our philosophy.
Toshiya Hari : Got it. And then as a quick follow-up for Thad. I guess what kind of utilization rates are you assuming for the current quarter? That's a quick clarification. Then my question is in terms of long-term gross margins, at the '21 Analyst Day, I think you gave a range of 48% to 50%. It sounds like your strategy -- the execution to your strategy has been really good in terms of your portfolio, your manufacturing footprint, et cetera. Is 48% to 50% still the right range? Or do you feel like there could be upside given the $160 million benefit you spoke to in your prepared remarks?
Thad Trent : Yes. So on the utilization rates, we expect that we'll be kind of in this range, maybe it's flat to down slightly in Q1. I think just given kind of the macro softness we're seeing here in the first half of the year, it's probably going to be -- remain in that range. And we'll see how the second half shapes up later. And what's the second part of the question? What was it? Can you repeat the second part?
Toshiya Hari : Yes, long-term gross margins, you gave a 48% to 50% range. I don't expect you to give us a preview on the May Analyst Day, but how are you thinking about the puts and takes? And I think you gave a number in terms of the benefit from transitioning manufacturing from your divested fabs. Any potential upside to that 48% to 50% long term?
Thad Trent : Yes. Look, we remain confident in that 48% to 50%. I said that in my prepared remarks. We've also said that target is a milestone, not a destination, right? We're confident in our business. We have a lot of tailwinds after we get through '23. So stay tuned on that, but we remain committed to the 48% to 50%. And believe that is a milestone.
Operator: Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar from Piper Sandler.
Harsh Kumar : First of all, some great color on Tesla, Volkswagen, JLR, particularly the traction inverter win at Volkswagen. I think that's huge. I had a question on gross margins. You're basically guiding gross margin 400 basis points, but you are saying that the headwind from silicon carbide is between 100 and 200. Should we assume that it's closer to 200 at the beginning of the year? And could you give us some color on how that number will trend? Do you expect it to be gone by the end of this year? Will it continue into next year? And then any color on Fishkill that 50 bps to 70 bps of headwind as well would be helpful.
Thad Trent : Yes. So let me start with the latter. The East Fishkill is 50 basis points to 70 basis points. You can think about that as being linear throughout the year and very consistent. That's where the foundry services that we'll be providing to GLOBALFOUNDRIES at kind of a low margin, low single-digit type margin. In terms of the silicon carbide, as I said earlier, we're really happy with the execution there. We're in that range of 100 basis points to 200 basis points. We think that starts to peak kind of in midyear. We think that based on what we can see now with the $1 billion run rate or the $1 billion number that we're going to hit in '23, we think we'll exit the year with that headwind behind us. So that's why I've said that 2023 is really a transition year for us.
Harsh Kumar : Okay. So it will be gone by the end of '23? And just curious about the softness in March. Have you seen any kind of noise cancellations in core industrial just outside of the consumer industrial? And a couple of the other companies have talked about cancellations in the auto business. I was curious if you've seen anything kind of strange over here in your auto business with increasing cancellations?
Hassane El-Khoury : No, no. This is Hassane. We haven't seen any of that in automotive. Like I said earlier, we still remain oversubscribed in auto. So it's not really a demand for us, it's more of a supply. So as we get more supply, we're going to be able to cover more of the demand. But cancellations have not been an issue in automotive. Obviously, we've seen cancellations. If I look at a trend, actually Q4 was slightly down as far as cancellations on the non-auto. So I think it's too soon to call it a trend. But it looks like it's getting better. But like I said, with our LTSAs, we're able to engage with customers for a win-win. So we don't see that impact beyond what we guided.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chris Caso from Credit Suisse.
Christopher Caso : Just a follow-up question on some of the industrial weakness that you saw. And recognize for you, the industrial market is very broad. And it sounds like you've seen some different trends there. Perhaps you could just give some more color on what you're seeing and how that looks like it's trending into midyear?
Hassane El-Khoury : Yes. Look, I think even last quarter, when we talked about the third quarter even, we talked about how some of the industrial markets that are closer to the consumer, like power tools and so on, those remain soft. We've seen softness in the broader market. Again, we believe this is more consumer and macro-driven, where we have been investing in industrial and alternative energy, that has actually been up, as I said, 75%, even ahead of our 60% growth target that we had. So that exceeded our expectation. That gives you the strength of the market that will continue through '23. And then pockets in the medical business that we focus on have seen a lot of growth, and we see that continuing in '23, obviously, offset by softness in other broader pockets of industrial. So no real change in the performance of that business or the outlook as we get into '23.
Christopher Caso : Just a follow-up on pricing. And I think you've been clear on a number of aspects of pricing. It sounds, like principally in auto, this is covered by the LTSAs in some of the noncore segments where pricing is declining, that's where you're exiting. But what about industrial, which I imagine probably more NCNR orders? Are you seeing any changes as the NCNRs tail off and you're signing new orders for these customers? Or is that pricing remaining resilient as well?
Hassane El-Khoury : No, the pricing is holding up because -- just to clarify one thing. Our industrial business, where I highlighted the growth and where we have been focusing and where we want to keep investing, those are -- those remain under LTSA. So the LTSAs are not only for automotive, but they are for growth areas where we have been putting investments and we want that return on the investments to be solid. So that carved out a big portion of the growth in industrial and puts it on high confidence. Obviously, the NCNR, we are getting the renewed backlog in these, and the backlog comes in at the same rate as far as pricing is concerned. So we don't see any softness there as far as pricing, even on the NCNR.
Operator: Our next question will come from Matt Ramsey from Cowen.
Matthew Ramsay : For my first question, I wanted to follow up on the last topic there that Chris brought up that you guys now have $16.5 billion something like that in LTSAs, only maybe 1/4 of that is from the silicon carbide business that gets a lot of attention. I wonder guys if you might spend a little bit more time on the rest of the business, LTSAs, where they're concentrated? I took note of the increase of $2.5 billion that you just announced from where the number was that you reported previously. So just where are you? Maybe a little bit more detail on the last answer of where you're seeing the strength in the market in order for a customer to be willing to sign up for those long-term agreements and other segments outside of silicon carbide?
Hassane El-Khoury : Sure. This is Hassane. So look, the LTSAs are broad in nature. I highlighted some examples where we have hundreds of parts for LTSA, and that goes back to the strength of our portfolio and the breadth of our portfolio as we target applications like electric vehicle electrification or autonomous driving or even parts of the industrial where we provide, for example, the sensing part of it as well as the motor control in the areas of factory automation, as an example. So all of these is really the strength of our portfolio. If I look at it, majority is automotive just because, obviously, it ties to the total market. Total market in automotive is larger. Therefore, our LTSAs are larger. And like you said, 1/4 of it is silicon carbide. So the rest is really the broad portfolio that we have. Image sensing, for example, remains a constrained technology. And given that is a very key enabler for autonomous driving in the future of mobility, that has customers really locking in supply in order to ensure that they have what they need as they start converting their vehicles to more ADAS or Level 2+ with more content. That's the breadth that I can talk about across all applications that we target.
Thad Trent : Yes. And let me just add that the $4.5 billion of silicon carbide LTSA is through '25. So it's actually a much larger number that's included in the in $16.6 billion of total LTSAs. But as Hassane said, it's broad. The place that we are not doing LTSA, obviously, is the noncore business that we're trying to exit. So we are intentionally trying to get out of that business.
Matthew Ramsay : Got it. That was helpful. As my follow-up, I wanted to ask on silicon carbide on a little bit of a different angle. There's acute focus for obvious reasons on materials and yields and whatnot. But Hassane, I wanted to know if you could talk a little bit about the work that the company is doing and potentially the differentiation of your products in areas like using depreciated fabs to do silicon carbide rather than building new facilities or packaging, heat dissipation, size of modules, everything downstream from the raw materials and just how your company is positioned there? I see lots of conversation around the materials and not as much around the rest of the supply chain.
Hassane El-Khoury : Yes. Look, that's a great question. So we've been obviously investing in brownfield. We've been very upfront about it. Given our manufacturing footprint and the optimization that we've been undergoing in the last couple of years, we're very well positioned to grow in there as we want. So let me give you some color. We have a large-scale manufacturing site in South Korea in Bucheon. That is an existing highly capable, high output power fab that today manufactures IGBT. What we've been able to do over the last few years is transfer that IGBT technology to East Fishkill converted to 12-inch. So there's benefit from that by itself, and then use an existing power fab with slightly fewer GAAP tools in order for us to run silicon carbide and start running silicon carbide in that fab. So that's what allowed us to ramp so quickly and with the CapEx efficiency that you've seen from us. That, for example, is on the front end. The same thing with the back-end. We have a very robust back-end footprint that is already leading in power and packaging for power semiconductors and modules. We've been able to retool those back-end factories in order to support our world-class modules that I mentioned in my prepared remarks for silicon carbide. So that's on the front-end and the back-end. Now right after the material that we've been talking about, there is, of course, capabilities of wafering and epi, and that's where we do it in the Czech Republic. We've been able to increase that capacity to match the output from our Hudson facility for substrates and to match the capabilities that our fab has been able to ramp to. So all of these three sites are what is increasing proportionately in order to support our not only the $1 billion, but you can imagine, we're investing in the '24 ramp and the '25 ramp based on those LTSAs. Those are coming in on track. Those are coming in on time. Obviously, equipment has been a challenge over the last few years, but we've been able to stay ahead of it given that we're utilizing our existing manufacturing footprint. So I'm very proud with what the team has done because it's not an easy task, but they have been able to do it, and that's obviously a testament of the capabilities of the team to run such a complex manufacturing. And we'll continue to invest in brownfield in order to support our long-term strategy.
Operator: And our next question will come from Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho.
Vijay Rakesh : Hassane, great guide here, given all the concerns. On the inventory side, just a quick question. Your inventories were up only 3% sequentially, which is probably the lowest among all the analog guys. Just wondering if you can give us some color on how inventories look in the channel and at the OEM level?
Thad Trent : Yes. Look, we're -- if you look at our inventory on our balance sheet, in terms of days that went up, as I mentioned, there are 26 days of bridge inventory for the fab transition in the silicon carbide ramp. If you look at that quarter-over-quarter, our base inventory, not the strategic portion of what the transition, the bridge is actually down. So you can see, we've talked about reducing wafer starts from earlier in the year, starting in Q2, and you can see that coming through our inventory. So this is just that our tight management of inventory. At the same time, in the channel, we've been managing it very tight as well. So we took inventory in the channel down by $10 million sequentially. It's at 7.3 weeks. We plan on running that really tight as well. We've been in that range for quite a while here, and we continue to go through the softness we'll manage both internal inventory and channel inventory very tight and just be cautious in terms of what we're seeing out there.
Vijay Rakesh : Got it. And then on the silicon -- sorry, go ahead.
Thad Trent : No, that was it. Go ahead, Vijay.
Vijay Rakesh : Yes. I know the silicon carbide side, just wondering what is -- if you can give us some color on what's driving the wins? Obviously, you compete with a lot of well-established suppliers on the silicon carbide side. What's driving the events and how defensible is it?
Hassane El-Khoury : Well, we're an established supplier too for silicon carbide. So that puts us in that bucket. But look, I remain consistent in why we're winning. A lot of people focus on technology as, call it, the silicon carbide wafer technology or something before that like substrates. I always couple the competitive advantage we have on technology as encompasses the wafer technology, but also the packaging technology. Any power semiconductor for us to be competitive and really win in the market, you have to have both. The best power silicon or silicon carbide die, if you can't get the heat off of it in a very light and efficient manner, then it's not going to work in the whole system. So we're able to do the best, highest power highest density power in a very light and cost-effective package using our road map and our innovation. Customers have validated that and customers have signed up for us. So the combination of the power, call it, semiconductor or silicon carbide plus the packaging co-developed is what puts us in the lead and customers are obviously seeing that benefit and signing up with us for those long-term agreements. So you have to have both, and we have the best of both.
Operator: Our next question comes from Joseph Moore from Morgan Stanley.
Joseph Moore : Thanks you for all the clarity on the silicon carbide customers. I guess when you look at some of those that have also been announced by competitors or associated with competitors. How is that business being split? Is it one vendor? Does the onboard charger, another uses traction inverter? Are there cases where people are multi-sourcing within those individual components?
Hassane El-Khoury : Yes. Look, I mean, in all fairness, let me just give you a little bit of a time-based questions. A lot of the ramps that are happening today are ramps that have been on, call it, three, maybe four years ago. Before onsemi was, call it, a credible and a focused player in silicon carbide, we talked about our strategy of doubling down on silicon carbide in 2021. So my focus and our strategy and a lot of the wins that we have are forward-looking. Obviously, they already started. They are ramping our -- for -- against that $1 billion we have in '23, but forward- looking. So how it's split, like I said, most of the platforms are single sourced. So I can tell you because the packaging is not like it's swappable. So most of them are single source. There are a few cases where we may share a platform, but majority of them are single sourced. And those will be ramping. Think about what we're winning now is in the '25, '26 and beyond. What we are ramping now has already been won a few years ago. So that gives you a little bit on the timing of what others have been disclosing, which is not a surprise to me, by the way.
Joseph Moore : Great. And then in terms of the forward-looking outlook, you guys talked about maybe exiting a higher amount of business than you have the last couple of quarters of $75 million. So how much of the cautious guidance is sort of the factors that you've talked about in the nonautomotive markets versus the ability to maybe at a less tight supply environment to exit some of those businesses more quickly?
Thad Trent : Well, it's really a combination of both, right? In Q4, we exited $17 million. It was below our expectations than what we thought we would exit. In Q1, we're looking at $75 million. So I think it's a combination of that. We're definitely seeing slowness in the other noncore markets, right? Consumer and compute has been down. It continues to be down. As I said, our automotive, we expect to be up sequentially in Q1. And we think industrial has got some headwinds as well. But so -- I would look at it as a cautious guide, but it's kind of taken into account the exits as well as just the overall softness that we're seeing right now.
Operator: Our next question comes from Rajvindra Gill from Needham & Company.
Rajvindra Gill : Congrats on the silicon carbide ramp. Just a follow-up on the long-term supply agreements. I was wondering if you could maybe talk about any changes that you're seeing within those agreements? I know a couple of quarters ago, you talked about certain customers requesting more volume near term, some customers extending the agreements, some customers requesting higher volumes. So any kind of positive specific changes within those LTSAs that you would like to call out or noticeable?
Hassane El-Khoury : Yes. Look, it's been the same. When we -- we've done a lot of amendments -- what we call amendment where customers came in and wanting more volume, and obviously, in the areas where we have been able to release volume because of the decline in the other markets and our ability to convert. We have been able to sign up for more volume for the customer, still, unfortunately, less than what their demand natural demand would be. But we have been able to increase that. So customers always engage with us on kind of almost what about now? What about now? Are we able to get that? Some of the technology or medium voltage bets remain constrained. Our IGBT remain constrained. Silicon carbide, obviously, we maintain our constraint. Image sensor, constraints. So we do have technologies across the company that remain constrained. So any opportunity we have where we were able to gain efficiency in our manufacturing footprint or convert from nonstrategic or non-core to core technology in our fab. We actually will either proactively, go and talk to our customers that we know we're not supporting 100% or they come to us with some mix. Some of it is, again, our sockets that we want to get to 100%. And lately, it's been where others cannot support and customers have come to us and those were -- have been share gains. So we're able to solidify those in an LTSA to sustain five to sometimes seven years length. So it's still -- the environment is positive as far as the LTSAs because it's more on a long term. It's not anything about what we can do in '23.
Rajvindra Gill : Appreciate that color. Just one follow-up in terms of the overall pricing environment. I know as part of your strategy, you talked about reducing the price to value discrepancy you after obviously have prices kind of locked in regarding the LTSAs. How do you think about the pricing environment, overall blended pricing this year as you see the benefits of those strategies, but then kind of offset by maybe the nonstrategic? So just kind of maybe talk -- walk me through the puts and takes on the pricing environment this year.
Hassane El-Khoury : Look, I think we expect the pricing environment to be stable this year. Our approach to pricing has been strategic where you mentioned, we're looking at price to value discrepancy we've done a lot of that. So that's all behind us. Right now, it's really focusing on supporting our customers with supply. So we don't see any, call it, pricing that we do. Obviously, we're always sensitive to costs, and we keep an eye up on cost. So if we do get cost increases that are not part of already our LTSA or cost increases that are new that we haven't gotten yet from some of the vendors, we are -- of course, we'll pass those on. But as far as the pricing environment, net of that, we do see it as stable.
Operator: This does conclude the question-and-answer session for today's conference. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Hassane El-Khoury, President and CEO, for any closing remarks.
Hassane El-Khoury : Thank you again for joining our call, and thank you for the thousands of onsemi employees who have had a direct impact on our exceptional results. As we enter this new year, amid a dynamic macro environment, I'm confident that we will maintain our momentum and navigate this market better than we ever have as a company. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today's conclude call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."
2888,RIVN,4,2022,2023-02-28 20:45:17,"Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to Rivian's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2022 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Tim Bei, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Tim Bei: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Rivian's fourth quarter 2022 earnings call. Joining us on today's call, we have RJ Scaringe, our Founder, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Claire McDonough, our Chief Financial Officer. A copy of today's shareholder letter is available on our Investor Relations website. Before we begin, I would like to remind you that during the course of this conference call, our comments and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today only and will include statements related to our business that are forward-looking statements under federal securities laws, including, without limitation, statements regarding our market opportunity; industry trends; business operations; strategy and goals; our production ramp and manufacturing capacity expansion; our future products and product enhancements, including R2; and our expectations regarding vehicle production and deliveries. Actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by these forward-looking statements due to risks and uncertainties in associated with our business, which are described in our SEC filings and today's shareholder letter. During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in today's shareholder letter. Just before the call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of our progress over the recent months. I encourage you to read it for additional details around some of the items we'll cover on today's call. With that, I'll turn the call over to RJ who will begin with a few opening remarks.
Robert Scaringe: Thanks, Tim. Hello, everyone, and thank you for joining us. 2022 is a transformational year for us. We fought through a difficult operating environment to ramp the R1T, the R1S and the EDV, with total production of 24,337 vehicles for the year. Beyond ramp, we focused our product teams on our next generation of in-vehicle technologies in the R2 platform. I want to thank our team, suppliers and partners for their grit and determination in helping Rivian achieve its targets. In the fourth quarter, we increased production over 10,000 units. This represents a 36% increase over the third quarter of 2022. We maintain a vehicle backlog that provides clear demand visibility well into 2024. We launched our Adventure Network, which gives customers a smoother charging experience. We expanded our service infrastructure to 28 physical service locations in addition to nearly 200 mobile service vans and we pushed a range of major software updates to our customers. Our core priorities for 2023 are ramping production of our R1 and RCV platforms, driving cost reductions, developing the R2 platform and its future technologies and delivering an outstanding end-to-end customer experience. In my role as CEO, my most important responsibility is to make sure we have the right leaders and the right organizational design in place to drive focus and execute on our priorities. It's great to see the very capable and experienced leaders we've added over the last year. Equally important to ramping production is our drive towards profitability. We are focused on reducing our bill of materials, conversion costs, logistics costs and overall operating expenses. Core to this is our close work with our supplier partners to lower our material costs through new engineering solutions as well as revisiting some of the customer and commercial negotiations that were agreed to years ago when Rivian was still in prelaunch. In support of these efforts, we held a Supplier Day at the end of 2022, where we hosted over 400 members of our supply chain at the plant to demonstrate the growth and the scale of what we're building. Our supplier partners are engaged and fully understand the benefits of us achieving profitability as quickly as possible. One of the enablers to reduce our material cost is the introduction of our future technologies. Earlier this month, we started producing saleable units of our in-house Enduro drive unit. Enduro is our single-motor drive unit, and in our commercial van platform, we use it in our front-drive application, and in the R1 platform, as a dual motor setup, we use it for all-wheel drive application. The Enduro drive units are also accompanied by our new lithium iron phosphate battery packs for our commercial van line. These LFP packs are ideally suited for commercial use cases due to their low cost and really the durability of this chemistry. Another important example of our technology development that I'm excited to introduce is the 390-mile R1S max pack variant. We begin deliveries on this vehicle this fall, and we expect high demand for this new offering. The R1S max pack will launch with the dual motor configuration, leveraging our Enduro drive unit, and will deliver 0 to 60 acceleration in around 3.5 seconds. And when we couple that with our full air suspension and electro hydraulic damping system, it will really deliver incredible on-road and off-road performance. The purpose of our investments in software, electronics, drive units and batteries is to improve performance and to create long-term structural cost advantages. These technologies will serve as the foundation for our R2 platform. Our production ramp and the introduction of multiple vehicle platforms has equipped our team with valuable manufacturing operations and product development experience in a short period of time. We're taking advantage of these learnings and are aggressively applying this experience to our first mass market vehicle, the R2 as well as to our new manufacturing facility in which we'll build the R2 located in Georgia with the goal of establishing a considerably lower cost structure.  Speaking of R2, we're really at an exciting and defining moment for the program. We have members across our organization, from design to engineering to manufacturing, coming together to develop what we believe is a true category-defining platform. Over the next 6 months, we'll be finalizing the majority of the core engineering and sourcing decisions that will drive how the R2 product line is built and the speed at which we can ramp production to profitability. We spent years creating our brand and award-winning set of products that drive excitement and attract new customers to what we're doing. The validation received from our customers and media continues to be strong. In fact, the R1T received several new accolades, including being named Best Ownership Experience among Premium Battery Electric Vehicles by J.D. Power. In addition to its Editors' Choice award, the R1T was also included in Car and Driver's coveted 10Best award for 2023. And along with that, it was praised as being the best driving pickup Car and Driver has ever tested. In consumer reports, customer satisfaction survey, Rivian was rated among the highest across all categories with our R1T being the highest-rated truck. We've also received the highest safety rating of TOP SAFETY PICK+ from IIHS, and that's passing IIHS's new tougher standards for 2023 across all categories. On our go-to-market side of the business, which includes our customer engagement, service, delivery and demand generation teams, we've experienced rapid growth over the past year as we built the foundation for our end-to-end customer experience and software and service offerings. We need to execute against our robust customer backlog and remain focused on our customers as we scale our 150,000 units of annual capacity in Normal into ultimately multiple production plants around the world. The enthusiasm for our products and our brand, combined with the progress we're making on our future vehicles and technologies along with the strong team that we've built, gives me confidence in our ability to help drive the massive impact we need this planet and the transition to a carbon-free economy. With that, I'll pass the call over to Claire.
Claire McDonough: Thanks, RJ. I want to reinforce the important steps we took during 2022 to drive towards profitability. Our goal is to build Rivian for the long term, to build a company capable of adapting during good times as well as challenging ones. In the last year, we took intentional measures to focus our product portfolio and drive a lower cost structure. Operating expenses in the second half of 2022 fell 21% as compared to the first half of the year. For the full year 2022, operating expenses were in line with 2021 results, while we continue to invest in and scale our delivery and go-to-market operations and next-generation technologies. In addition, our team was able to reduce our capital expenditures for 2022 to $1.4 billion versus $1.8 billion in 2021 due to the fact that our equipment and facility costs were more highly concentrated leading into our start of production in Normal. We're encouraged by this progress and recognize there is an additional opportunity to drive greater efficiency. We are concentrating our investments and resources on growing the consumer business while continuing to leverage our existing commercial platform. We believe these core aspects of our company represent the greatest levers to maximize our impact and drive attractive financial returns. I will now review our fourth quarter 2022 results. The last 12 months were characterized by economic uncertainty as well as significant supply chain volatility across the industry. By focusing on factors within our control, our team was able to achieve meaningful milestones. During the fourth quarter, we produced 10,020 vehicles and delivered 8,054 vehicles, which generated $663 million of revenue. We generated negative gross profit of $1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2022. Gross profit for the fourth quarter was impacted by a lower of cost or net realizable value, LCNRV, adjustment. As discussed in the past, the LCNRV adjustment breaks down the value of certain inventory and records losses on firm purchase commitments to the amount we anticipate receiving upon vehicle sale after considering the future costs necessary to ready the inventory for sale. As of December 31, 2022, LCNRV was $920 million as compared to $95 million as of December 31, 2021. These charges are expected to continue through 2023. However, as we reduced cost of goods sold per vehicle by lowering material production, logistics and other costs, we anticipate that the total charge will decline. We forecast reaching positive gross profit in 2024 and therefore expect by the end of 2024, we will no longer have material LCNRV inventory charges and losses on firm purchase commitments associated with the production at our Normal plant. In addition to LCNRV, there were factors which negatively impacted our cost of goods sold that we do not believe are reflective of our long-term cost structure. The most significant driver continues to be our production levels. Producing highly vertically integrated vehicles at low volumes on lines designed for higher volumes means we currently carry more overhead per vehicle produced. This impact has and will continue to be magnified during the ramp of our second shift in production as we introduce new technologies like our LFP battery pack and Enduro motor, for which we stopped the commercial production line for the majority of the first quarter of 2023. Additionally, because we are in an LCNRV position, we do not fully capitalize our logistics and conversion costs into inventory, which can lead to volatility in our cost of goods sold based on the amount of inbound materials we received in a particular quarter or the difference between our vehicle production and deliveries as we saw in Q4 2022. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter of 2022 fell $1.3 billion as compared to the same period last year. Approximately $1.1 billion of this difference was due to higher noncash expenses in the fourth quarter of 2021, including a donation to Forever by Rivian and stock-based compensation in conjunction with the IPO. The remaining reduction of approximately $200 million was due to lower cash expenses associated with the operations of our business. We continue to prioritize investments in our core in-vehicle technologies and customer experience while also driving additional focus and cost optimization across the business. Our adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2022 was negative $1.5 billion, which compares to negative $1.1 billion for the fourth quarter of 2021. We ended the fourth quarter of 2022 with $12 billion in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash. This excludes the capacity under our $750 million asset-based revolving credit facility. We continue to monitor the economic environment and believe we have a high level of flexibility regarding the cadence of our growth investments. I want to take this opportunity to highlight important operational changes we're making in Normal. In addition to the commercial van line shutdown during the first quarter of 2023 which we expect to result in a drop in overall production and deliveries relative to Q4 2022, we also expect to be taking both the R1 and EDV production lines down for a week during the fourth quarter of 2023 to prepare for a capacity change which will happen in 2024. In the first half of 2024, we intend to take production of the plant down for a few weeks to implement new technologies into our vehicles and shift the overall capacity of the plant to be about 55% R1. While the incorporation of these new technologies temporarily impacts production, they are expected to provide improved vehicle performance and range and deliver cost reductions that are critically important to our path to profitability. Now turning to our 2023 outlook. We are guiding to 50,000 vehicles produced for the year. This represents a doubling of year-over-year production while also accounting for the risks and uncertainties associated with the supply chain and integration of our new technologies. We expect the ramp of our second shift for the R1 line to continue to progress through the first quarter. We expect full year production to be back-end weighted due to supply constraints we believe will alleviate in the second half of the year and the commercial line downtime we're taking in Q1 2023. During 2023, our gross margin is expected to remain negative, but we anticipate improving on a dollar basis for the year as we reduce our cost of goods sold per vehicle produced, improve our average selling prices per vehicle and begin to see our LCNRV charge decline. For 2023, total operating expenses are expected to modestly increase as compared to 2022. As a result of these factors, adjusted EBITDA is expected to be negative $4.3 billion in 2023, an improvement of $900 million versus 2022. We continue to rationalize our capital expenditures due to a greater focus on our core business. Capital expenditures in 2023 are expected to be $2 billion driven by additional investment in our Normal and Georgia facilities, next generation technologies and the continued build out of our go-to-market operations. In addition to our 2023 guidance, I wanted to address the capital needs of the business over the medium term. The largest lever in our forecast is the swing from negative $1 billion of gross profit in Q4 2022 to a step change in positive gross margin in 2024. There are 3 key levers that enable this improvement. First, the most impactful driver is the per-unit reduction of labor overhead and ramp expenses as our large-scale plant produces a greater number of units. With the addition of our second shift, the plant in Normal is currently staffed to produce a significantly higher number of units than our current run rate. For context, these expenses represent 2/3 of the bridge from our current COGS per unit to what we expect by the end of 2024. The second area is our material costs. We have a detailed road map of both engineering and commercial cost downs. As RJ mentioned, our recent Supplier Day demonstrated the win-win opportunity for our suppliers to participate in Rivian's growth. The final bucket is price. The implementation of our reservation system in early 2022 provides us the pricing flexibility to accommodate the introduction of new products, technologies and inflationary pressures. While most of our deliveries today are based on pre-March 1, 2022 pricing, we expect to see a meaningful step change in average selling price over the next 2 years as we introduce new higher-priced variants as well as move to our post March 1 preorders. In addition to the gross profit improvements I outlined, we expect to see significant leverage of our operating expenses over this period as we leverage our R&D and SG&A expenses over a much larger sales base. We also anticipate being able to maintain our capital expenditures in the low $2 billion area over this time frame. Our objective continues to be driving towards profitability and our prudent deployment of capital. From a cash burn perspective, we expect 2024 to improve versus 2023 by approximately 40%, enabled by the step change we see in gross profit. In 2025, we expect our cash burn to improve meaningfully versus 2024 as we have a full year of production at our new price points and the incorporation of our next generation technologies. We remain confident that our cash and cash equivalents can fund our operations through 2025. We continue to evaluate a variety of capital markets available to Rivian ranging across the capital structure. We plan to employ a portfolio-based approach as we look to maintain a strong balance sheet position. In closing, I want to reiterate our confidence in our long-term financial targets. We see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high teens EBITDA margin target and approximately 10% free cash flow target. With that, let me turn the call back to the operator to open the line for Q&A.
Operator: [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research.
Rod Lache: Just a couple of things maybe just to kick things off. Do you have an estimate for the magnitude of the LCNRV losses you expect in 2023?
Claire McDonough: Thanks, Rod. As we think about the LCNRV, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, right, today, we sit with a $920 million charge, and we expect that charge to be fully offset or out of our P&L in effect as we approach positive unit economics in that 2024 time frame as outlined. And so what -- the guidance that I would provide for you is as you think about the cadence of that $920 million going to 0 is it won't necessarily be a linear path over the course of the next several quarters, but we will start to see those impacts even as early as Q1 as we start to reduce the material costs within our vehicles, and importantly, as we think about the technology introductions that we have in EDV, for example, where we introduced the LFP pack and Enduro drive unit that drives a material step change in material cost there. So for example, the marginal unit that we're producing today for that EDV is now profitable due to some of those changes that we've had from a technology introduction perspective. But we'll continue to see what's been a headwind throughout the course of 2022 become a tailwind as we look at '23 and '24.
Rod Lache: Okay. So it's actually going to decline. So it would be a subtraction from your cost of goods sold, just to clarify that, in 2023?
Claire McDonough: That's correct.
Rod Lache: Okay. And RJ, I was just hoping maybe you can give us some preliminary thoughts on how different the R2 cost structure will need to be compared to R1 to be competitive when that vehicle comes out? And what's your visibility into achieving those? Maybe talk a little bit about -- we think about batteries primarily when we think about that, but what are some of the non-battery opportunities that you see? Are there any unconventional design or manufacturing innovations that you're looking to implement for that vehicle?
Robert Scaringe: Thanks, Rod. As we think about the R2 platform, it's leveraging a lot of -- some of the technologies we're going to be introducing into R1 in terms of our updated electronics architecture and network architecture where we work to really consolidate a lot of compute functions into a smaller number of ECUs, which simplifies the harness, simplifies the number of compute platforms you have across the vehicle. As Claire mentioned, our Enduro drive units and the, really, focus on vertically integrating our propulsion platform from a drive unit point of view drives considerable cost changes into R1. But we take those improvements, and we leverage those heavily for R2. And in the case of the vehicle, as you think about body, interior chassis system, we've really learned a lot in developing and launching R1 and the EDV program. And so the way we've looked at the design of the product is really through the lens of where we can see opportunities to consolidate parts, so larger single piece stampings, use of parts consolidation through extrusions or castings. And that part consolidation not only reduces the number of parts of the vehicle, but as a result, there's less joints, there's less things that need to be attached to one another. It simplifies the assembly process. It simplifies the sourcing process. And so that's a major, major focus for us with the R2 product. And really the magic of it or the core of it is to ensure that the brand essence and the excitement of what we build is still fully captured in the R2 product line, but of course, achieving it with a meaningfully lower cost structure. The other thing I'd just point out is, and I noted this in my opening remarks, we're in a very different position with our supply chain today than we were when we were sourcing a lot of our supply components for R1. A lot of the components or a vast majority of them are sourced in 2018, 2019, well before we launched the product, well before we saw the incredible response from customers around the brand. So today, as we're now making those supplier selections, negotiating the supplier contracts in R2, we're not only using the R2 contracts to help drive better cost into R1, but we're achieving much, much more aggressive cost and much more aggressive pricing with all the various components across the vehicle. So in aggregate, we are going to see a materially lower cost structure for R2, and that's, as I said, that's foundational to how we think about that product.
Rod Lache: It sounds like, RJ, you're thinking about things like Giga castings and just a lot of innovations in reducing the number of parts in the structure of a vehicle. Do you, at this point, have visibility into that? And are you starting to get visibility into what the component cost structure will be for the R2? And just lastly, do you have any color on -- as we're sort of bridging to profitability, for gross profit profitability, what kind of volume targets are you thinking about as you look out to 2024? You mentioned the 150,000 units of capacity, but do you think you can get to at least 100,000 in that time frame?
Robert Scaringe: Well, just to your first point on how we're thinking about component design or system design across the vehicle. One of the things we spend a lot of time on across all the different tech layers of the product is looking for opportunities at a holistic level or at a system level to reduce complexity and reduce the parts. So whether that's in, I'll take, for example, in our Enduro drive unit, we took the gearbox, the motor and the inverter, those are typically 3 different subassemblies that are mechanically fastened together. And in the case of Enduro, those -- we call it 3 in 1, those 3 systems are captured into 1 casting. So we designed this system really holistically to take 3 different parts, combine it into 1, reduce the number of fasteners, of course, increase the assembly and build time, or decrease the assembly and build time for the drive unit. But that mentality, that mindset we're applying to everything, whether it's a seat frame, whether it's a door system, a drive unit, as I just described, of course, body structure is a big opportunity for this as well. So this is something that we carry into every design review. It's part of the design criteria that we approach the vehicle with, and it's one of the big enablers that we have because we vertically integrated so much of the technology. I mentioned it before, but the ability to dramatically reduce the number of computers in the vehicle, the number of ECUs through a zonal architecture, we have a computer in the front, the computer in the back, computer in the middle, so to speak, rather than separate domain-based or function-based computers, which is historically how you've seen vehicles done today, and it's largely a result of an outsourced model around electronics. So these are some of the core focus areas where we're leveraging what we've built in terms of capability and what we've built in terms of technology as we go into R2.
Claire McDonough: And Rod, maybe...
Rod Lache: And the volume?
Claire McDonough: [Indiscernible] directly on the volume question that you have there as well. As I talked about in my prepared remarks, today we have 65,000 units of R1 capacity in the plant at Normal, and we're increasing that capacity so that 55% or call it, 85,000 units will become R1 capacity as we re-rate the lines midyear next year. And so next year, we'll have both the impact of having a multi-week shutdown as we re-rate the plant to add that incremental R1 capacity. And at that same time, we'll be introducing a number of the next generation technologies that RJ just talked about as well. And so we'll still be in a period whereby we'll be continuing to ramp out of that shutdown in midyear to produce more units in the back half of the year, but it really won't be until full year 2025, where we'll be ramping up the then re-rated capacity from an R1 perspective.
Rod Lache: So just to clarify what you're saying, are you saying that you're not going to have the 85,000 units of R1 capacity available for 2024? Or will you?
Claire McDonough: It will be available. We're re-rating the lines midyear in 2024. And so from a full year perspective, we won't have the full year impact of that re-rate as we go through the process of a couple of weeks shutdown and then ramps back out of that shutdown in the back half of the year.
Rod Lache: Okay. But despite that, you're still thinking that you can get to gross profit in 2024?
Claire McDonough: That's right.
Rod Lache: Okay. Just to clarify that, that's -- I could see -- it looks like you're going to have something like a $2 billion gross profit loss in 2023. Maybe there's half of the LCNRV benefit left from 2023 to 2024. That gives you maybe $1.5 billion, and you have a $13,000 price increase. If that was applied this year, that would have been $650 million better. So that would have gotten you to maybe an $850 million gross profit loss. I guess the rest of it is whatever volume you're expecting plus lowered component costs. Is that fair as we think about the bridge to next year?
Claire McDonough: As we think about that 2024 bridge, right, it's a combination of increased volumes that are driving significant fixed cost leverage within the business as we're continuing to ramp up production levels in the plant in Normal. And then the next 2 core drivers for us is the reduction in our material costs, which you heard RJ talk a bit about, is really delivered through both the combination of engineering design changes in the vehicle through the introduction of these next generation technologies and then the commercial cost-down efforts that we have underway overall. So I would guide you to about a 50-50 split as we think about the core drivers between commercial cost downs and engineering changes to drive the material cost reduction. And then at the same time, we have both the step change in pricing as we move past the pre-March 1, 2022 preorders, and then we also introduced some of the newer higher-priced variants into the fold as well that also further improves or increases ASP in 2024.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy with Bank of America.
John Murphy: Just a first question around what's going on with suppliers. It sounds like there's still a fair amount of bottlenecks there. Just curious if you could sort of elucidate where those specifically are, how much they're holding you back. And I mean I kind of applaud you, RJ, for having that Supplier Day. It sounds like it's a good thing to build those relationships, but it sounds like you felt like you needed to do that both for sort of comfort on their part, but also for you to get maybe closer to them and pull them along. So I'm just trying to understand what those constraints are at the moment, how much they're holding you back in 2023 and why you need to kind of get in there and kind of do that bear hug on that Supplier Day.
Robert Scaringe: Yes. Thanks, John. As we look at 2022, there's a lot of challenges just with some of the surprises and the things that we didn't expect in terms of supply interruptions and component availability. Now as we look at 2023, we have much better visibility and a much clearer picture of access to supply and where there are going to be challenges or constraints. And very different than where we were last year. That visibility allows us to focus on exactly what will go wrong or what will be a gap. And as I said today in the numbers that Claire referenced earlier in terms of guidance, it really reflects supply constraint, in our case, around power semiconductors. And this is being addressed through working hard with suppliers, but also as I talked about bringing up the new driving at the Enduro drive unit, we've sourced the power semiconductors for this in a way that allows us to have multiple to continue to ramp. So we have a different set of power semiconductor suppliers for our existing driving unit as a quad motor from what we have in the dual motor and in the single motor for the commercial van. So those changes of the new technology, along with the supplier relationships we've built, allow us to alleviate some of that constraint, but it will be the ultimate limiting factor for us this year. And fortunately, unlike last year, we can plan around it. We have this building into what those constraints look like. So it's not going to be a surprise, which is why we're wanting to be thoughtful on how we guide here.
John Murphy: RJ, there's a lot of people that want to understand what is sort of -- I mean, it's certainly not onetime because this is not going to ease that quickly, what's happening because of the supply chain side and what's happening because of what is not getting done sort of internally on a micro basis. So is there a way to tease that out and say, hey, listen, if we had all the semis that we could get, we can actually be 100,000 units as opposed to 50,000 units this year, right? I mean is there a way to tease that out? Or is that getting too cute?
Robert Scaringe: Well, I think the issue we have is that the supply constraint is, by far and away, the biggest constraint. We talked about our second shifts coming online and the ramp of our second shift. We didn't really talk about why it's -- what's constraining that ramp, but it's ultimately -- it is component supply. And that's on the R1 line today. If you think about the commercial vehicle line, we're still running a single shift there. So it's -- we wish we could have the components still to fully run the plant across all lines, across multiple shifts, but that's not the case. And as I think about power semiconductors, in addition to having multiple sources of supply, we also have different types of technologies. So we use both silicon carbide and silicon IGBTs, and we have some level of fungibility in how we apply those across the vehicle sets. But it's -- I think you understand very well that some of the constraints that exist in silicon carbide are going to be challenging over the next year, and so we've worked really hard to set up our supply chain so as we come out of this year and into 2024, we're positioned to really grow. And of course, as we think about R2, this is a major consideration from a power module point of view.
John Murphy: Okay. And then just lastly, real quick. CapEx at $2 billion is a little bit lower than we would have expected. Claire, is that the kind of thing that you can kind of run with as you're launching Georgia and the R2 and ultimately maybe the R3 at some point? Or could there be a significant step-up as that plant ramps in '24, '25, and we see the R3 come on there as well?
Claire McDonough: Sure, John. As I talked about, our expectation is that we'll maintain our CapEx in the low $2 billion area over the next couple of years and the guidance reflects the continued build-out of our facility in Georgia, continued investment in our plant in Normal and then the continued investments that we have across our go-to-market operations as well as across the business in aggregate. So the way I would characterize it is that the $2 billion per year certainly sets us up in a position to launch R2 in Georgia in 2026, as we've talked about in the past.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Doug Dutton with Evercore ISI.
Doug Dutton: So given the target for positive gross margins in '24 and what we've heard about the road to reach this goal with the LCNRV phaseouts and rerates at the factory, in your mind, can '25 approach a normalized gross margin profile, assuming full capacity at Normal and price to normalization on the R1 platform prior to sort of R2 coming online? And a follow-up there, is that target still 15% to 20%?
Claire McDonough: Sure. Our long-term vehicle gross margin target is 20%. And then through the introduction of additional software and services, we've guided to a long-term overall aggregate gross margin target of 25%. Our expectation is through the continued ramp of the R1 and EDV in Normal, we can certainly arrive at our target vehicle margins, and 2025 becomes really that sweet spot as volumes come together and we have our first full year production with the integration of our next generation technologies and price points as well. So I have a lot of confidence around the cash flow generation that Normal can provide Rivian, and believe that Normal can support our operating expenses as a company as we continue to invest in the build-out of the R2 platform and get ready to start to launch that platform in Georgia in '26.
Doug Dutton: Okay. That's helpful. And then just an accounting question for me. Could we have a brief description or explainer on the CapEx and liabilities bucket at the bottom of the cash flow statement?
Claire McDonough: We can follow up with you with some details there.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Dan Levy with Barclays.
Dan Levy: Wanted to ask about the commentary on the preorders, and I see the comment that, that lasts into 2024. Maybe you can provide any additional voiceover. How have preorders trended year-to-date? And specifically, maybe you can -- you mentioned pricing as a tailwind. You have the higher pricing flowing through eventually. But given the price cut that we saw from one of your large EV competitors, how does potential for price cuts eventually factor into your calculus?
Robert Scaringe: Thanks, Dan. As you think about the R1 product line, this is really our flagship product line. It's -- we've built it and launched it to establish the brand and as part of that. The pricing levels and the segments through which these products are going to compete in, it's a larger set of vehicles, the 3-row SUV and 3-row pickup. The pricing levels really need to be compared to things that are in those segments, and we feel very strong about where we position the products. The R1T, we bring online our standard pack, we'll start at $73,000, and the R1S is just around $80,000, 3-row SUV with very, very strong performance. So the positioning there, we feel confident. We made pricing adjustments in 2022, and we haven't further adjusted from there. Certainly, as Claire noted, our reservation process now gives us more flexibility to make adjustments to pricing over time, but we do see the introduction of some of the new technologies and some of the new features to allow us to actually grow ASP, as Claire said, with not only the new prices coming on for post-March 1 orders, but also to reflect some of the new technologies that are going to be in the vehicle.
Dan Levy: Great. And as a follow-up, I wanted to ask about the direction of some of the material costs. And I know you mentioned on your end, some initiatives to drive cost down. But I want to just ask about the raws because we've seen some cost moderation on the raws. So maybe you can just talk about whether some of the raw material costs are coming down? Or I know there's a dynamic of contract resets. And so those might be higher year-over-year. So maybe you could just talk about the underlying BOM given the movement in some of the raw material costs.
Claire McDonough: Sure. Today, we haven't seen those actually hit our financial statements because many of our contracts are actually backwards looking as it pertains to inflation index prices that are embedded within those contracts. And so we'll begin to see some of those benefits as we progress throughout the course of 2023 itself. I would also say that embedded within our guidance, we've been a bit conservative of not forecasting really significant reductions in those material costs overall. So much more projecting more of the status quo of what we're seeing today on a go-forward basis.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of George Gianarikas with Canaccord Genuity.
George Gianarikas: I'd just like to piggyback on the previous demand question, that preorder question. I know you're not disclosing the preorders, but given there have been so many high-profile admissions of a weakening environment for demand, particularly for EVs, I'm curious as to whether you could shed any light or color as to how your net preorders have been tracking?
Robert Scaringe: Certainly what we're witnessing in the macro and what we're seeing in terms of interest rate is, I think, across the industry, having an effect of moderating overall demand. But what we would say is, and as we think about it, the demand backlog that we have is very robust. It gives us a clear line of sight until well into 2024. And with that, it really focuses the attention of the organization on satisfying this large backlog and ensuring that we can get customers vehicles. One of the biggest complaints, in fact our customer team tells me this every week, is around delivery timing. How can I get my vehicle sooner? Is there a way to get ahead in the line? So this is our core challenge today. Now with that said, it's really important to note with the R2 program, we made comments on this earlier, the focus on cost and the focus on engineering the vehicles really to achieve a materially lower price point is key. And as we look out into middle of the decade, 2026 and beyond, this cost structure, we believe, is going to be really important. And some of the areas we've invested in terms of vertical integration, we think, will be foundational for delivering on those costs.
George Gianarikas: Just as a follow-up, great segue into my question about vertical integration. I mean I'm sure you've read the same press releases that I have that some of your peers are getting incredibly deep into that. I mean they're partnering with mines, buying mines, buying stakes in mines and doing things that seem to be a little bit far field. I'm curious as to how much vertical integration in your opinion, is too much vertical integration? Do you think that longer term, that might be something that you might explore as well?
Robert Scaringe: Yes. Well, George, I think the core of the question is sort of pointing towards lithium. And your previous question talked about raw material costs, and this has certainly had the most outsized impact across the EV industry, with lithium hydroxide spot market price hovering around $80 a kilogram, up 4, 5x relative to what it was a year, 1.5 years ago. So this is a real consideration as everyone, certainly ourselves included, thinking about what's the right sourcing relationships for lithium in lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, and we're certainly in midst of a lot of those discussions. And I think it's causing the material sources and, in our case, the manufacturers, the OEMs, to think about deal structures that are very different than what existed 2 years ago, 3 years ago, 4 years ago. That could involve ownership positions, but I think for the most part, the opportunities lie just more in unique structuring. And so we haven't announced anything on that front, but it's something I spend an enormous amount of time on and work very closely with some of the very large players in this space.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo.
Colin Langan: You're burning through -- this year, you burned through over $6 billion in cash. You have $12 billion. So you have a couple more years of cash at this rate. I mean if I look at the guidance, adjusted EBITDA is supposed to improve a bit, the CapEx is higher, so it sounds like free cash flow may be modestly better this year, but not massively. What are your thoughts on the potential need to raise capital? When do you start making those decisions? Or should we see a pretty massive inflection in a couple of years?
Claire McDonough: On -- we'll continue to look at a variety of capital market solutions to maintain our strong balance sheet position. We plan to execute a portfolio-based approach for our capital raising across the entirety of the capital structure. And as I mentioned in my prepared remarks as well, we expect to see pretty significant moderation from a cash burn perspective in 2024 relative to 2023 as gross profit or the movement from negative gross profit to positive gross profit is a key lever in that walk of improvements. And then as we talked a bit about as well, 2025 is significant improvement from there as well.
Colin Langan: Got it. I think in the last call, you mentioned you're planning an LFP plant. That's not actually in the near-term horizon. Any thoughts on raising capital to accelerate that given the health at a higher rate that might apply there?
Robert Scaringe: Yes, Colin. As I referenced in the context of lithium supply, if you move slightly downstream from a battery supply point of view and thinking about IRA, there's going to need to be investment in new capacity. And the types of structures and arrangements to achieve that dedicated capacity, there's lots of different ways to look at that. That's something, certainly, that's part of our plan and something that we're spending time on. We haven't announced anything on that front either, but it is a very important aspect of what we're doing in terms of creating new supply, creating supply that's IRA compliant, both in terms of raw material but also in terms of cell production.
Colin Langan: And you have your own LFP chemistry? Or do you have a partner for it? Or you had your own?
Robert Scaringe: So we've -- when we think about the build-out of our battery, overall battery portfolio, we have an internal team that's developing chemistry, and it's working to really understand across a variety of trade-offs how we think about what's the right cell for different duty cycles and for different applications. And that internal team also works very closely with some of our key partners to make sure that we can achieve the scale very quickly that we need to. So in the case of what's in our vehicles today, it's a high nickel chemistry. That's something we've worked very closely with our supplier partner to develop that and to refine that to achieve the performance in our vehicles today. With the LFP that we're going to be launching shortly first in the commercial vans, that's in close partnership that we haven't yet announced, although those vehicles in the form of the vans will be on the road here very soon. And then as we look forward, there's going to be portfolio of different partners and different approaches to achieve the scale we need across different cell form factors and cell chemistries, both high nickel and lithium iron phosphate.
Operator: Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Brinkman with JPMorgan.
Ryan Brinkman: I wanted to get your thoughts on any impact to Rivian you see from the Inflation Reduction Act. I remember as that bill was being written, it was speculated it could have been various different proposals. But in the end, it only subsidized the lower-priced vehicles, right, and benefits those manufacturers that are making the batteries that are vertically integrated or partnered, which you have yet to do. So do you see any benefit in charging or other tailwinds? And how do you expect or hope to or plan to position the company to better benefit from that act as the next several years play out?
Robert Scaringe: Yes. So I think the IRA bill, I've said this before, I think it's incredibly aggressive and appropriate to drive a broad scale shift towards electrification and to build out a supply chain within the U.S. And with that, in the case of our R1 product line, there's some tailwind, some benefits that it provides largely in the form of -- because we build modules in the U.S., we have a $10 per kilowatt hour benefit that's derived from IRA on the R1 platform. That's a manufacturing-facing benefit. But in terms of the consumer-facing credit, our vehicles aren't really applicable on the R1 platform.  Now in the case of R2, it's a very different story. In the case of R2, as alluded to in previous questions, it's really important that we ensure that the vehicle and the way we manufacture the vehicle and the batteries in the vehicle ensures IRA compliance. The price points need to be considerably lower and fall really right into the sweet spot as contemplated by IRA, and the sourcing of the critical materials plus the build of the cells, the manufacturing of the cells needs to be done such that we qualify for the $7,500 credit that is consumer-facing. So that's foundational to how we're thinking about the R2 program and platform and certainly plays into sourcing decisions and engineering decisions.
Ryan Brinkman: Okay. Great. And also just a follow-up on that earlier Q&A around pricing, the up to 20% price cut on -- some of the Tesla models, Ford and some of the others, et cetera. But I'm sure there's passing along of lower input costs in all the battery metals, but is there anything else? It just seems like a large reduction, right? So how are you feeling about the demand, the new order intake level or whatnot for the prices that you're currently charging?
Robert Scaringe: I think as I was describing before, in the case of R1, we feel confident in the value proposition of what we're delivering at our pricing levels today. And if you were to compare, take, for example, the R1S to other 3-row SUVs that offer the level of range and performance that the R1S is delivering, it's really -- we think of it as it's a really good deal. Of course, we get biased here, but 0 to 60 in 3 seconds, well over 300 miles of range. As we just announced today, we have a max pack range with 390 miles of range, which when coupled with the Enduro dual motor configuration delivers 0 to 60 in 3.5 seconds. And to be able to deliver that at the types of pricing that we're talking about relative to the competitive set, it's positioned quite well. Now as you said, there's been price reductions that we've seen on the order of 20% in vehicles that are more in the R2 market basket, if you will. And a lot of that segment has seen significant price inflation in the first half of 2022, and I think we saw the prices go up very rapidly. And we, of course, saw the other side of that, which is the prices come down very rapidly. I think what we're seeing today is reflective of a more stable and sustainable long-term pricing model for vehicles that are in the sort of midsized crossover and SUV segment versus what we were seeing in the mid -- early parts of 2022 into middle late part of 2022.
Operator: Our last question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: One for me, please, was about the re-rating discussion and specifically around the timing and how much of the capacity is being shifted towards R1. I had thought that R1 capacity might be adjusted to something like 2/3 of the facility and perhaps that might be taking place later in 2023. So maybe you could update us on what may have changed in terms of the timing in '24 and the 55% that you spoke about today.
Claire McDonough: Sure, Mark. As we looked at the re-rating process within the plant, we really tried to optimize around the level of investment that would be required to increase that re-rate capacity. And as we've talked about in the past, desiring today to maintain the 150,000 units of installed capacity in Normal, but just slightly tweak that more towards the consumer side of the business today. And so that was really the way that we calibrated around the trade-offs on how deeply we would have to disrupt the line or the level of downtime that would be required to make a more material increase in the production capacity of the R1 line as we thought about this re-rate process itself. So those are some of the core considerations that we went through as we evaluated the re-rate opportunity for us. And after we sort of go through this re-rate, we'll obviously think through additional opportunities to increase that potentially over time as well.
Mark Delaney: That's helpful, Claire. And on the IRA, thanks for all the comments you made already so far. But in terms of demand from commercial customers, including for the delivery van, have you seen any change in terms of customer interest levels and when they may be able to or may be interested in taking vehicles?
Robert Scaringe: Thanks, Mark. I should have actually commented on that in the context of IRA. Just to be clear, the -- for commercial vehicles, the requirements of domestic cell production are much different. And so in the case of our commercial vans, they're applicable. And in the case of R1T for commercial applications, it's also applicable. So we do see that, and we see that's something that certainly, some of the business owners that are buying R1Ts are leveraging. And then in the case of the commercial vans, this is something that we think is going to be very important. And we're seeing that as we talk to customers outside of Amazon, we see this as a very important enabler, and it helps ignite this large-scale transition of our commercial vehicle fleet towards electrification.
Operator: Thank you. I would now like to turn the conference back over to RJ Scaringe for closing remarks.
Robert Scaringe: All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining the call, and thanks for the questions. As I said in my starting comments, we're really excited about what we see in front of us. 2022 was an important year for us. It was a critical year where we launched and ramped 3 different vehicles between the R1T, the R1S and the EDV platform. And as we look into this year, more than doubling the overall output, but importantly, getting a lot of customers or a lot of vehicles into a lot of customers' hands. We'll start to see a lot more of these on the roads, whether that's the commercial vans or the consumer vehicles, the R1T and the R1S. And as that ramp continues and as we start to see more and more of our vehicles on the road, as Claire and I both described, the core focus for us is driving cost down across the business. Some of that will happen naturally as volumes go up when we get the fixed cost leverage that Claire described in some detail, but that's also happening through the engineering changes we're making and this really heavy focus on the commercial relationship with all of our suppliers. So with that, we're very excited about the year ahead and looking forward to getting a lot more vehicles on the road and our path towards profitability. Thank you, everyone.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
3318,ON,1,2021,2021-05-03 16:22:18,"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the ON Semiconductor First Quarter 2021 Earnings Conference Call.  I would now like to turn the call over to Parag Agarwal, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Thank you. Please go ahead.
Parag Agarwal: Thank you, Denise. Good morning and thank you for joining ON Semiconductor Corporation’s first quarter 2021 quarterly results conference call. I am joined today by Hassane El-Khoury, our President and CEO and Thad Trent, our CFO. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.onsemi.com. A replay of this webcast, along with our 2021 first quarter earnings release will be available on our website at approximately 1 hour following this conference call and a recorded webcast will be available for approximately 30 days following this conference call. Additional information related to our end markets, business segments, geographies, channels, share count and 2021 fiscal calendar are also posted on our website. Our earnings release and this presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures with the most directly comparable measures under GAAP are included in our earnings release, which is posted separately on our website in the Investor Relations section. During the course of this conference call, we will make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company.

Our Analyst Day is scheduled for August 5. We plan to host an event in New York City and we look forward to seeing you all in person in the summer. We will send out further details regarding the event in a few weeks. Now, let me turn it over to Hassane. Hassane?
Hassane El-Khoury: Thank you, Parag and thank you everyone for joining us today. For the first quarter of 2021, we posted strong results driven by solid execution and broad-based strength across our strategic end markets. We reported revenue of $1.48 billion, up 16% year-over-year. More importantly, our focus on gross margin expansion is beginning to show results, with first quarter gross margin increasing by 370 basis points year-over-year and by 80 basis quarter-over-quarter. We have taken steps to optimize our product portfolio and channel strategy to ensure that we capture the right value for our products and these steps will continue to drive favorable and sustainable results. At the same time, we continue to drive cost improvements throughout our supply chain, improving efficiency of our operations and shifting our product mix towards higher margins.
Thad Trent: Thanks, Hassane. Let me start by saying that I am energized to join ON Semiconductor at a very exciting time for our company. We have tremendous opportunities to create value for our shareholders, customers and employees as we execute our strategic transformation. We have the building blocks of a robust product portfolio, excellent teams and operational scale to drive sustainable financial results during this transition. Now, let me comment on the current business environment. During the first quarter of 2021, we saw continuing recovery in business conditions, driven by further acceleration in global economic activity. We are seeing broad-based strength across most end-markets as semiconductor content continues to increase in the products we encounter in our daily lives. As Hassane mentioned, we continue to benefit from the secular megatrends in automotive and industrial end market, which now account for 60% of our total revenue. Although the industry is faced with severe supply constraints globally, we have supported our customers through a proactive inventory management by taking channel inventory down, while holding more on our balance sheet. We believe supply and demand will start to balance later in the year. Now, let me turn to results for the quarter. Revenue for the first quarter of 2021 was $1.48 billion, an increase of 16% over the first quarter of 2020 and 2.4% quarter-over-quarter versus normal seasonality of a sequential decline of 2% to 3%. The year-over-year increase in revenue was driven by broad-based strength with automotive and industrial growing by 16% and 17% respectively. Gross margin for the first quarter of 2021 was 35.2%, a 370 basis point improvement year-over-year and an 80 basis point improvement sequentially. The gross margin improvements are being driven by improved mix to higher margin products, improved utilization and our laser focus on cost structures across the company. Our factory utilization was 84% as we ramp production to align with the strong in demand. As we move forward, our fab lighter strategy will allow us to continue to reduce our manufacturing footprint and optimize the mix of products within our fabs to reduce our overall cost structure. GAAP earnings per share for the first quarter, was $0.20 per diluted share as compared to a net loss of $0.03 per share in the first quarter of 2020. Non-GAAP net income for the first quarter of 2021 was $0.35 per diluted share as compared to $0.10 per share in the first quarter of 2020.
Operator: Thank you.  Your first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. Congrats on the strong results and guide. I guess the first question I had is on the supply side. Obviously, demand is strong across the board. But on the supply side, Hassane, I wondered if there is any impact limiting your revenues from supply limitations either internally or elsewhere in the supply chain and probably more importantly, any impact of your product rationalization efforts on your total revenues and then just how that process is going currently?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. Thanks, Ross. So look, the obvious answer is yes. It’s impacting our ability to ship to the demand that we have. So, revenue could have been higher if we did not have any constraint in a perfect world. However, we are where we are as an industry, but that’s not really impacting what we are doing moving forward on the portfolio rationalization to answer your second question, because it’s actually helping us. We kind of know already based on the strategic reviews that we have done, where we are going to be landing and we are putting priority on these products, especially when it comes to internal utilization. Like Thad mentioned, we have good utilization this quarter. Now, it’s really maintaining the optimization and running the growth and the high margin products within our fabs and that fits very well with the rationalization, creating more capacity for the products that we want to maintain.
Ross Seymore: That’s a perfect segue to my follow-up question Hassane or Thad, either one of you guys. The utilization, I think, Thad, you said is at 85% already. It’s good to see that back to normal levels. Can you talk about some of the drivers of gross margin going forward? The product optimization you just mentioned Hassane is an obvious one, but I assume that’s going to take a little bit of time to bear fruit. So, the second quarter gross margin is showing a nice pop, is that simply the utilization rising again and kind of what are the steps to get that gross margin from the 36.5% to 37% up to your target range with before handle?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. Look, we have launched a gross margin initiative corporate wide. So, there is not a single pop that caused the margin in Q2 that we guided to. It’s really across the board. Of course, some of it is utilization, but we have a laser focus on cost optimization within the supply chain. We have been talking strategically with our customers about some of the cost increases that we have seen and how we pass some of those on. There is operational efficiencies that we have been doing. We have seen some of that start in the first quarter. And that’s why I called it the favorable and sustainable moving forward that’s kind of where you are going to see us clicking up. Utilization will get better over time, but more importantly, where the lift for gross margin is going to be is what I mentioned in the prior answer is as we start shifting more of our internal capacity to higher gross margin products and offloading the, call it, the legacy or the harvest product line, that’s going to create a mix shift to the higher gross margin that will come of course with better utilization.
Ross Seymore: Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Danley with Citi. Your line is open.
Chris Danley: Hey, thanks guys and I will add my congrats on the strong quarter and outlook. So, would you say that the shortages are getting better in Q2 or getting a little worse? And then how do you expect this easing of demand you talked about in the second half of the year? Could we have like a sub-seasonal quarter or do you expect to go from above seasonal back to normal seasonal?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. So look, the expectation is really what we are talking with our customers and how I would call it the velocity of how fast the demand is coming. I talked last call that the problem has not been really on the capacity per se, it has been on how quickly that demand came and layered on a very strong quarter. So, that’s the velocity. So, when I talk about demand and supply and demand subsiding in the second half of the year or towards the end of the year, I am not talking about really demand going call it weaker or backwards. I am talking about the momentum, but it will remain at a very healthy and not – and better than seasonal outlook. So, that’s where we see the demand. But the balancing of us being able to catch up to the demand is going to happen, I would say, towards the second half of the year.
Thad Trent: Yes. And Chris, this is Thad. I would just add, if you take the midpoint of our guidance for Q2, that’s our record for the company, right. It’s up 9% sequentially. As you look into Q3, I think coming off that high mark, we will be sub-seasonal in Q3 and then probably return to seasonal in Q4.
Chris Danley: Okay. Thanks, guys. That’s helpful. And then for my follow-up, I guess between your own input costs and raw material going up and then any chance for, I guess, firmer pricing on your products, how do you expect the total impact of that to be towards margins? Do you think it kind of negates everything out or do you think that, that could be a little bit of lift to the margins as far as like your own pricing goes versus the input costs?
Hassane El-Khoury: It’s – pricing is a small portion of our gross margin trajectory, because obviously right now we are in a favorable environment, but what we are looking for is those sustainable pricing structures and sustainable cost structures that will remain favorable and the up or down. And that’s you always hear me talk about structural gross margin improvement. That’s how we are going to get there. So to answer your question more directly, there is not a one size fits all. It’s not a one to one. It’s really talking to our strategic customers in order to reset, one, is the cost basis. But more importantly, in some cases, there is a value to price discrepancy and we are even covering that with some strategic customers and commitment to a longer term supply, because today, that’s really the most important thing is how do we prevent this, where we are today from happening to our customers over the next 3 to 5 years. That’s really where the focus is, is getting those agreements, getting those long-term views for us and the customers both on supply and on pricing.
Chris Danley: Okay, great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my question. Hassane, you mentioned – Thad mentioned Q2 up 9% sequentially, I was hoping you could give us some color on which end markets could be above or below that number? But then also importantly, you are guiding to record sales in Q2, but gross margins will still be 200 basis points below right prior peaks and I am curious what’s causing that delta?
Hassane El-Khoury: So, the demand is pretty broad. So, there is not a single end market Obviously, all our focus and our strategic end markets are going to see strength, and that really is mirrored across the industry when you talk about auto and industrial and so on. So, I wouldn’t say there’s a one specific end market that’s going to drive the majority of it.
Thad Trent: Yes. On the gross margin compared to the historical, if you go back to 2018, which was the peak, I believe, was Q3 of ‘18, our – the midpoint of our guidance for Q2 would be about 5% higher than that peak. But you are right, the margins are lower, and that’s primarily because of the investments the company has been making in the capital, so our depreciation has been going up as we have been ramping up the balance in East Fishkill. Obviously, as we go forward, and we rationalize that footprint because that will give us some opportunities to improve those margins as we talked about as well. But that’s the primary driver and the difference between the two.
Vivek Arya: Got it. Thank you. And for my follow-up, I am curious, Hassane, how does – what we have seen in the last few months is companies that had better internal capacity, right, are able to withstand this chip shortage issue better than their competitors. So, as you think about ON for the next few years, how does kind of reducing lead time and being responsive to customers align with the goal of having a lighter fab footprint over time? Do you think you can achieve both, be very responsive to customers, but still have a lighter fab footprint? Thank you.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes, absolutely. I am highly confident that we are able to do both. And from – obviously, we have been working on the rationalization of our portfolio and the manufacturing footprint since I joined the company. And I see a path for achieving both. And that’s going to be really with the rationalization. When you have a pretty broad footprint, it could be as easy as streamlining technologies within a fab, you will get better utilization, you will get better cost while still running a very different set of products. It doesn’t change really the overall products you run. It will change the volumes at which you can run per fab by just streamlining on a technology basis or even in the back end on a package basis. By removing all these inefficiencies, we are able to even get more out of our existing fab footprint or back-end footprint. And then as we restructure and consolidate, you are going to get that volume upside to maintain our growth. So we are going to be able to get both confidently.
Thad Trent: Yes. And Vivek, just to clarify, right, as we talk about being fab lighter, it’s not necessarily going outside. We will still run the same volume in our fab. It will be just as long as a higher throughput in those fabs and then also looking at subscale fabs and doing something with those to reduce that footprint. But it isn’t necessarily shifting from inside to the outside.
Vivek Arya: Got it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Raji Gill with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Raji Gill: Yes. Thank you and congrats on the good momentum. Thad, just a question on the decision to kind of build inventory on the balance sheet, while simultaneously reducing inventory in the distribution channel. Maybe you could walk us through kind of the rationale of that decision? And when you are talking about kind of demand-supply rebalancing later this year, can you give us some thoughts in terms of kind of where we are right now and what are the steps that you are taking in order to kind of get the supply in balance relative to demand? Is it more demand is just decelerating? And then or is the combination where demand is decelerating and supply is starting to increase to meet that level of demand? Thank you.
Hassane El-Khoury: Sure. I think I lost track of the first question.
Thad Trent: The first question is on the balance – sorry on the balance sheet.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. Yes. Okay, so let me address that, sorry. So, we made the decision, obviously, we were running at about 11 weeks of inventory last quarter. Our target range is 11 weeks to 13 weeks of inventory in the channel. We dropped it to 8.4 weeks. The logic there is it doesn’t make sense to have inventories sitting on the shelves of the distributors versus supporting customers. So, by holding on our balance sheet, we can support the customers either through the channel or directly, but it allows us to ensure that we are allocating the products to the right customers at the right time versus just having it sit in the channel for extended weeks. So, it was a proactive decision basically for customer support.
Thad Trent: No, I mean, I was going to tackle your second question about demand. So from the demand perspective, it’s really there are a few things going on. One is a lot of the work that we have done that I mentioned earlier about changing the mix and streamlining our footprint, we have more supply coming online. Not through capital expenditure, but literally through streamlining our operations, part of the initiatives that we have for our strategy. So, that’s going to help increase our supply, but also the velocity that the demand came in will start to subside, which means that we are able to get more visibility on what the steady-state demand is in order for us to build for that. What’s been happening is we get the demand signal, we start the wafers, then the demand gets stronger, we start wafers. But those wafers have a latency before they get out, and that’s why we are in the supply constraint. But as we are getting more stable, outlook of demand which remains by the way at a very healthy level, I am not talking about demand going backwards, I am talking about the velocity, the demand kind of stabilizing. We are able to start material for that demand, and that will get us towards the end of the year on a balanced supply and demand picture.
Raji Gill: And for my follow-up, in terms of the automotive market, you had record automotive revenue, as you stated. Can you talk about kind of what you are seeing in that industry as we progress throughout the year in terms of SAR production, are we done with the kind of the component shortages impacting production? Do we still have more way to go? And so how do we think about the overall industry? And then how do we think about kind of your momentum in silicon carbide and electric vehicles?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. I think as an industry, automotive is going to remain strong. There is low inventory across the board. I don’t know when anybody try to buy a car lately, but there is not no inventory anywhere, whether it’s rental cars or new cars or used cars. So, that’s going to fuel the strength that we are seeing. And obviously, we do have pockets where some of the OEMs have reduced production because of the supply. And we do have some ad hoc issues in the industry. Like unfortunately, the renaissance fire that happened in the fab, that also has an impact on where the demand is going to be. But that doesn’t change the overall picture for automotive being one of the strongest years I have seen. Our momentum remains very strong. Obviously, we keep talking about a content story. So, as those vehicles are back online, we are going to see our content grow with that, and that’s part of our growth trajectory, not just for this year, but moving forward. And that includes our silicon carbide. I am very close to our silicon carbide initiatives here in the company. And more importantly, I am watching very closely and personally engaged with customers on platform design wins that are going to fuel our growth from the revenue and the margin. But what I like about our silicon carbide story is, we are not just on the electrification of the vehicle itself, although that’s a great area, we are also engaged on the infrastructure, whether it’s onboard charging or infrastructure charging. That’s going to also fuel because as we get more and more EVs on the road, we need to have an infrastructure to charge them, and we are engaged with that. And that’s also going to be part of the industrial strategy for us.
Raji Gill: I appreciate it. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.
Toshiya Hari: Hassane, I wanted to come back to your comment about Q3 revenue potentially being sub-seasonal. You talked about very strong demand across your key markets. Inventory up and down the supply chain seems pretty low, including your distis channel, and you have got idiosyncratic drivers of growth in power and image sensors and so on and so forth. So I am just trying to better understand why Q3 would be sub-seasonal given the backdrop? And then I have got a quick follow-up.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. I mean, if you talk about sub-seasonal, Q3 is usually up 3% to 4%. But you have to remember, we are coming off of a 9% up quarter in Q2, which is typically 3% to 4% down. So, when we talk about seasonality, for this year, you can throw that a little bit out the window. What we are looking is just maximizing our supply in order to meet the maximum demand we can. So, demand remains strong. So, even if we talk about sub-seasonal Q3, that’s still a very healthy Q3 coming off of a second quarter with a 9% sequential growth.
Toshiya Hari: Okay. So, from your standpoint, is supply a bigger issue in Q3 than it is in Q2? Is that a fair statement or no?
Hassane El-Khoury: No. I wouldn’t say it’s bigger. I think we are still going to be navigating the same supply constraints that we see.
Toshiya Hari: Okay. Got it. And then as a quick follow-up, I was hoping you could give us an update on Belgium and Niigata. I know you are in conversations with potential counterparties, but any update there? And I think on prior calls, you have mentioned each fab potential sale would give you 10s, 20s of millions of dollars in cost savings? Does that continue to be the case? Thank you.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. I mean, we have nothing new to report. Obviously, as soon as we conclude anything, we will make sure that becomes public. But where the status you stated is exactly where we are.
Toshiya Hari: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is open.
Vijay Rakesh: Hi, guys. Great quarter and guide out of the box. Just a question on the automotive side. You mentioned silicon carbide. Obviously, on the EV side, that continues to grow. Any thoughts on how you see that percentage? And how you see that growing in ‘21, ‘22? And what is it as a percent of your auto revenues there? Thanks.
Hassane El-Khoury: I think it’s going to stay. We don’t break it up specifically. We look at our electrification, both silicon carbide and IGBT that’s been growing. It’s going to continue to grow. And as more silicon carbide sees its way on the penetration as far as technology from the IGBT as customers crossover over next, call it, 2 years to 3 years, we are just going to be growing our content with that. But right now, our focus is layering in all the design wins in order for us to be able to do that. And we are on track.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. And on the 300-millimeter side, can you give us some idea of how you are ramping that, where do you expect utilizations as you look out this year, next year as you move some products into 300-millimeter as well? Thanks.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. I mean we are on track to move in this, but just to remind everybody we don’t take ownership of the fab until 2023. So, until then it remains an outside fab, but our focus is to make sure all of our products that we want to be running there is in there, not just qualified internally but qualified with our customers, so when we take ownership of that fab, we are able to ramp it as planned.
Vijay Rakesh: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Your next question comes from Craig Ellis with B. Riley Securities. Your line is open.
Craig Ellis: Yes. Thanks for taking the question guys. Congratulations on the strategic progress so far. I wanted to start with a longer term question, Hassane, you mentioned that you are working on some long-term agreements with some of your customers. The question is what percent of sales could those be in 2021? And as we look out over the next 3 years to 4 years, how much larger could those long-term agreements be as you have a couple of years to work on it. And to use auto as one example, would that mean, for example, that in auto, you could actually accelerate the premium industry growth that I think the company has talked about 10 percentage points or would those long-term agreements really leave relative growth unchanged versus what the company has been looking for?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. I wouldn’t say it will change our growth target because our growth targets are pretty aggressive when you compare them to the SAR numbers over the next few years. So, I am very comfortable with those. Now of course, from the prior question, if silicon carbide accelerates faster than what we think, then that’s going to be higher growth for us than we expected. So, there are some puts and takes on the growth trajectory. And that’s why what the growth we have provided is a pretty well balanced growth. As far as the long-term agreements, I look at them as more outlook confidence. If you look out over the next few years, we want to be able to spare capacity. We want to be able to potentially build or shift capacity into the strategic products we want. And we are engaged with customers to make sure that their demands over the next few years are met. And that comes with a 2-way where we make sure the investments are made in the areas where we see the growth. And from the customers side, the investment is made in order to give us the visibility and the long-term agreement for us to make sure that we are building for the right domain. So, it’s a win-win for our strategic customers. We have been working with a lot of them in order to make sure that what we experienced in 2021 does not occur again. And that only comes with a steady and outward-looking demand signal that they will commit to.
Craig Ellis: That makes a lot of sense. And then the follow-up is for you that. So, a number of times in the commentary prepared and Q&A, the company mentioned strategic mix out. The question is, are we starting to see that in the business, for example, I noted communications was down 10% year-on-year in the first quarter, when will we see that impact peak in the business? Is that later in 2021 or would that be sometime more distant in 2022? Thank you.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. As we go through our strategic review process, it’s too early to really see those results coming through our financials at this point. I think you will see that shifting much further out in 2022, probably hitting the revenue numbers. So, I wouldn’t look at this quarter as being indicative of the strategic markets that we are focused on. Obviously, auto and industrial will be strategic to us, but I wouldn’t read more into that on a short-term basis.
Craig Ellis: Thank you. Good luck.
Operator: Your next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Christopher Rolland: Hi, guys. Thanks for the question. There have been some rumors about some CMOS image sensor tightness out there. Can you guys talk about that market specifically? And are there any supply constraints there that you guys are seeing, whether you specifically or anywhere in the supply chain for those modules? Thanks.
Hassane El-Khoury: The short answer is yes. We see it – most of it is – well, all of it is foundry for us, and we all know the foundry situation. Part of our allocation strategy that I have been discussing or hinting at during the call applies to image sensing. But for sure, there is tightness in the market.
Christopher Rolland: Great. And then perhaps tying into that as well, just a discussion about East Fishkill. So 2023, that’s when you guys get the fabs. But are you able to ramp meaningfully before that? Is there some additional capacity that you can kind of touch there? And then this supply chain tightness that we have seen out there, has that accelerated qualifications or re-qualifications from other fabs to this fab? You have talked about $2 billion-plus of revenue. So I guess, putting all the pieces together, where are you guys going to be in 2023 when you get this fab in terms of utilizations, in terms of ramping to that $2 billion plus revenue? Has this put you guys in a better position? And where do you see that position? Thanks.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. Look, we still have a few years on. We have looked at the products that we are moving. We have reprioritized in order to make sure the products we are moving with higher priority are the strategic products, the growth products that I have been talking about, part of the portfolio rationalization. So those, of course, we are going to try to accelerate. But as you know, with a lot of product quals, it is not how hard or how fast you work, it takes time to qualify. There are x number of hours you have to test and those hours have to pass. We can do parallel quals we can do customer quals, and we are doing all of the above to make sure that when we take ownership of the fab in 2023, it has the maximum utilization we can get to at that time given all of the demand that we have. As far as the short-term, of course, we maintain a close relationship with global foundries that operates the fab, and we navigate the supply constraints, just like we do with any outside foundry.
Christopher Rolland: Thanks Hassane.
Operator: Your next question comes from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Chris Caso: Thank you. Good morning. The first question is about the production plan as we go through the year. And it sounds like you would be ramping production pretty significantly now to catch up on supply, and that’s obviously having a margin benefit now. What does that look like as we go into the second half with revenue potentially flattening out as you go to Q3? Does that mean utilization comes down a bit or – and I guess, what does that imply for gross margins as we go into the second half of the year?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. As I mentioned, utilization is currently at 84%. It was mid-70s last quarter. As we look through the remainder of the year, we think it’s going to stay right in that level based on the projections we are seeing in the backlog. So, when we talk about the second half coming back into balance, it’s balanced really at this level, right. So, we don’t expect the utilizations to drop much through the remainder of the year.
Chris Caso: Alright. So just as a follow-on to that, given what some of your peers have said about expecting tight supply through the year. Do you expect you will still have the opportunity to improve the mix as you go through the year, prioritize some of the higher-margin products and therefore, still get a mixed benefit as you go through the second half?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes, absolutely. I mean that’s – we have already started doing that. And we hope to get more favorable mix and optimize those fabs as we go through the rest of the year, and that will give us some tailwind on the gross margin, additional tailwind. So, that’s what we talked about, right, is that the next phase of the gross margin isn’t all about utilization, it’s really about optimizing the footprint and optimizing what’s going through those fabs to increase the throughput.
Chris Caso: Yes. Very helpful. Thank you.
Operator: And your next question comes from Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is open.
Matt Ramsay: Good morning. Thank you. Hassane, as you think back to when you were thinking about joining the company and when you came into the company, it seems to me like the – as you think about modernizing or rationalizing the footprint of manufacturing, I don’t know if you guys would have thought about the extreme 6-inch and 8-inch tightness across the industry when you started putting the plan together. So, I wonder if you might reflect on that a little bit. Are there anything new variables or has the aperture sort of broadened for strategic options as you think about it, given the tightness and the likelihood of 6-inch and 8-inch tightness persisting across the industry for a longer period of time? Thanks.
Hassane El-Khoury: No, from where we look at it obviously, we had to re-look and revisit our base line assumptions. And I will tell you it hasn’t changed, because the fact or the matter is not the 6-inch or 8-inch tightness that is driving, it is how effective can we run those fabs at the scale that they are in versus consolidating or moving from, for example, 6-inch to 8-inch, as an example. So, it doesn’t change what we need to do, which is we need to streamline our manufacturing footprint, we need to consolidate, and we need to have all our fabs be at a scale that we can drive lower cost and as we keep those fabs fully utilized, that cost will basically spread across all products that we run in. So, it doesn’t change the valuation of these fabs as far as the market is concerned. But when we decide to potentially divest any of those assets, they will just bring in more than they did when I first started.
Matt Ramsay: Fair enough. That makes sense. As my follow-up, you guys mentioned in the prepared script, strength from computing and also strength from GPUs. Maybe you could talk about how big are those markets for you guys specifically that you called out driving some upside? And are those particular products at the richer end of the mix? And are you, I guess, planning on those sustaining through the balance of the year? It seems like those would be fairly high-margin products into those markets. Thanks.
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. Our product focus on – in these segments. First of all, those segments are not a big percent of our revenue. However, they are very, I would call them, adjacent to our power product offering that we have in the auto and industrial where we bring a lot of value in these GPU cars and so on, which have seen some growth. So, we are able to support that growth, but I will just reiterate, we are able to support that growth once we have fully supported our automotive and industrial customers, which are part of our strategic markets.
Operator: Okay. And your next question comes from Kevin Cassidy with Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.
Kevin Cassidy: Thank you and congratulations on the great results. Your CapEx spending at $77 million came in lower than, I guess, guidance, guidance was $90 million to $100 million. Was that just due to timing of the equipment delivery or is there some other change that’s happening?
Hassane El-Khoury: No, that’s just the timing of the cash payments, right. So, you can think about it still being in that 7% range long-term. This quarter it just happened to be lower on a cash basis, but no change in strategy at this point.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay. And can you say what percentage of that goes towards the 300-millimeter and how much maybe for 8 inch?
Hassane El-Khoury: I don’t have the breakout, but I would say the majority of that is going towards the 300-millimeter today.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay. And so is there – I guess, what is the lead times for 8-inch equipment? Or can you still find used equipment?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. Well, yes, because our investment or CapEx in the 8-inch is really maintenance or upgrade investment, back to what I mentioned, streamlining, removing some bottlenecks in the fab. So we’re not looking at purchasing heavy equipment. And as you streamline and consolidate some of the lines within a physical location, we have the flexibility to move some equipment from our own from one spot to the own from one spot to the next in order to remove any bottlenecks that are specific to a fab. So we haven’t hit any roadblocks in what we aim to achieve in the 6 or 8-inch fab trajectory we have.
Kevin Cassidy: Okay, great. Thanks for clarifying.
Operator: Your next question comes from John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Yes. Again, thanks for letting me ask the questions. Congratulations on strong results. Hassane, I’m a little curious on this inventory strategy. To what extent is taking on more inventory tactical to try to kind of make sure your customers aren’t building much inventory? And if you can comment on what you think end customer inventory that would be great? And to what extent might this be a little bit more structural? And as we think about use of cash, how should we think about the use of cash relative to your inventory strategy?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. I would say, John, it’s tactical. When we have strong demand and strong signals from our customers coming to us directly, regardless of how we fulfill either direct or through distribution, the customer engagement is direct with us. And being able to have those conversations and move inventory where we need to move it in order to support our strategic direction and back to our portfolio rationalization, it is better for us to hold that inventory than put it at the distributor and have them ship at their discretion, I would say, based on their backlog or their order. So from that perspective, it is purely a tactical approach to how we believe we are able to support it. And that worked very well for us. We had a great quarter that we just talked about. We have a great outlook. That’s all part of it. That is a tactic. Now as far as longer term, obviously, we’re going to be talking about rationalizing our inventory management, both in the channel and internally, because that has to match the velocity at which we are able to get our products from start to finished goods. How do you stage products in die bank and how do you stage products and finished goods is going to depend on the rationalization and really the efficiency of our manufacturing footprint, and that’s going to drive a change in our capital allocation for inventory management. And again, it’s either internal or external. For me, it’s the same. It is inventory that needs to be monetized by getting on a customer board.
Thad Trent: And John, on the cash, I wouldn’t expect the inventory to increase the balance sheet inventory to increase. I think over the longer term, it will come back into balance, but we’re not looking to increase it further. We think this is about the right level for this tactical, as you call it, tactical move in managing the inventory on a short-term basis.
John Pitzer: That’s helpful. And then for my follow-up, Hassane, I was a little bit surprised about two things. One, that pricing is not a big part of what’s going on right now. And two, neither is portfolio rationalization? And the reason why is, if I go back and think about what you historically did in the NOR market, if memory serves me correct, you used periods of strength to kind of price customers out of the market and move that portfolio more aggressively. I guess, why aren’t you doing that now? Are these just different markets in the sense that they’re more socked and it’s hard to do that without kind of not supporting your customers? Or why isn’t the portfolio rationalization happening more quickly?
Hassane El-Khoury: Well, let me put it this way. We are doing that. It is happening quickly, but there’s a lot of pieces to it. If you think about it, it’s not going to have an impact in Q1. It’s starting to have an impact in Q2, and it’ll have more impact, talk about Q3 and Q4 because there is backlog that we have accepted before that we’re going to support. There is pricing actions that we are doing, like you said, to price some opportunities out of the market because we’re not going to be supporting them. But that all is going to help towards the end of the year as we get through the portfolio rationalization. But as far as happening quickly, we are. Because one thing you have to also remember, the difference with it is when you have the tightness in supply, if I’m not shipping and the customer because of strategic reasons on the portfolio and the customer can’t get that product from somewhere else they’re not going to build that boat that I’m also on with products that I do want. So we have to make sure there’s some production that’s still going, and that’s the trade-off we’re able to make.
John Pitzer: Thanks helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Your line is open.
Harsh Kumar: Hey guys. First of all, congratulations on a very strong guide. I had two questions. Hassane, first one for you, I know silicon carbide and power for cars in automotive is a focus area. If I had to ask you, what is your view of ON’s position in that market today with your products? I know if I asked you where you want to be, you would say, number one, but I’m curious where you are today? And I’m curious what you think needs to be done to get to that top-tier slot?
Hassane El-Khoury: Sure. We are in a very good place, and it’s only getting better. It’s – today, it’s better than it was when I first started. So that’s kind of the focus that we have. How is it going to get better, to use your term for us to become number one, which, of course, we play to win and we don’t dabble. That’s going to be with a focus and an investment strategy, and that’s the work that we have been looking at. But that’s the work we’re looking at for silicon carbide and a lot of our other segments that – and the technology in order to make sure that when we pick a vector, be it silicon carbide or anything else that we’re able to sustain it over the next 4, 5 years and investments in products in order to get to that leadership position.
Harsh Kumar: Great, so. And for the next one, I just wanted to ask you and Thad, about the cost side. So as you look at some of the cost initiatives that you guys have started on, would you say that you could have done are sort of underway and close to getting done and the hard work has started? Or where would you sort of characterize where you are in the process of cutting costs?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. It’s not the hard and easy way, it’s how long it takes to implement and get the benefit of. We can implement, if I use the two categories, we can implement two things. One is easy, one is hard. The easy one is implemented, but it’s not going to see results for another quarter or so. We’re doing all of these in parallel. Obviously, anything that is, what I call, low-hanging fruit has already been launched and initiated. The question is, have we seen all of the benefit of it? The answer is no. So it’s not really – I look at it as the timing to get or reap the benefits of hard or easy implementation. What we have done is we’ve launched a lot of them in Q1. You’re starting to see that benefit in Q2. And back to my prepared remarks, those benefits are obviously favorable, but more importantly, to me, they are sustainable. So it’s a cumulative effect as these things kind of start showing the benefit, they’re cumulative on what we’ve already established as a baseline. And that’s the gross margin trajectory that we are – we set ourselves up for.
Harsh Kumar: Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur: Good morning. Great job on the quarterly execution. The ISG business was down about 2% sequentially, it was up 9% year-over-year. I believe auto and industrial make up a majority of ISG revenues. And these two end markets combined are up 5% sequentially and 17% year-over-year. So the largest delta does appear to reflect the capacity constraints on foundry that you guys talked about. Similar to your overall business, do you guys expect that ISG foundry capacity to be more in line with your demand by the fourth quarter of this year?
Hassane El-Khoury: So ISG specifically, obviously, the revenue is 100% constrained by supply. So that is a one-to-one supply constraint. And that will remain through probably the first half of 2022. That’s the one business that will remain a little bit out of balance between the supply and demand, given the growth in that market with ADAS and everything. We’re working very closely with our foundry partners to get more capacity, obviously, because we have a lot of common customers with the microcontrollers or the advanced nodes that they ship. And that’s how we’re going to be able to get a little bit more capacity. We do have a path to more capacity for the second half of the year. That’s capacity that we’ve negotiated in the first quarter. So of course, that’s going to alleviate some of that gap, but it was not – it’s not going to resolve it, but it will get us closer to it.
Harlan Sur: No, I appreciate the insights there. And then despite the potential for Q3 revenues to be, maybe a bit sub-seasonal, I would assume that the team would expect gross margins to continue to move higher. I mean you already seem to be executing to a focus on a higher mix of gross margin products. So while Q3 revenues might be seasonal, should we expect gross margins to continue to move higher as we move through the second half of the year?
Thad Trent: Yes, Harlan, this is Thad. We expect gross margins to continue to expand through the remainder of the year. This is from a lot of the things we’ve talked about, whether it’s the cost initiatives, also the mix. The benefit of the utilization and the cost structure in the fabs, but yes, we do expect even as revenue is coming back into balance, we expect gross margins to continue to accelerate.
Harlan Sur: Yes. Great job. Thank you.
Operator: Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Jefferies. Your line is open.
Mark Lipacis: Hi, thanks for taking my question. Hassane, a lot of time, what happens at this part of the cycle is you get OEMs and contract manufacturers order more components than they need. Some people call that double ordering, some call it, building inventory, safety stock. And then what happens to industry adds capacity, lead time shrink and then the requirement for that safety stock declines and semiconductor companies see the quarter cancellations. So the questions here are is this cycle – can this cycle be different than all the other ones? And as I listen to how you’re planning to retool ON’s manufacturing operations, I’m trying to figure out if you’re insulated from this dynamic in some way for your future portfolio? And I had a follow-up. Thanks. 
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. So if you think about a lot of the commentary that we’ve talked about, all of that is to – in order to set us up to be more distance from any cycle that that as you say is expecting. It’s the same thing that happened in ‘18 or coming out of ‘18 into ‘19. So what does that about holding the inventory on our balance sheet versus putting it in the channel because that gives us a more clearer and quick response to the true demand signals. It’s much harder to put double orders on our direct book rather than through the disti. So that gives us much better visibility, the engagement, not just with the Tier 1, but with the OEMs directly. When you have an OEM that is going lines down in a few days because they’re not getting parts, I guarantee you, there’s no double ordering in that. Nobody has got those products on the shelf and causing an OEM lines down. So that’s another signal that we look at. Again, more responsive when we hold the inventory than what it is – when it is in the channel. As far as the portfolio rationale or the manufacturing footprint, specifically, that’s why I said, we’re very cautious about investing to add more capacity versus removing some bottlenecks as we change the product mix in our manufacturing, just changing that bottleneck so we’re not adding CapEx that will end up loading us with depreciation. It is adding very light investment in whether it’s a tester or one machine in order to get that throughput out, in order to support the high demand but not really impact our long-term utilization outlook that we want to maintain in that 85 plus. So all of these, whether they shield us, I can’t comment on that because who knows what the cycle would look like. But what I will tell you is it will make us much more immune than just letting it ride.
Mark Lipacis: Very helpful. Thanks. And then I have a follow-up. The OEMs that seem to be doing better right now are those that abandon these just-in-time inventory processes and built inventories on their own volition last year. And I’m wondering if you’re hearing from your customers the desire to take that approach even as you and other semiconductor companies plan to increase your own days of inventory on your own balance sheet?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. It’s not – I wouldn’t say it’s common across the board. There are still some customers. Unfortunately, they are in denial. And we’re working with them, but everybody has a decision to make. We can make the decision for us, and they have to make their own decision about how they want to manage inventory. But I will tell you, the just-in-time error is not going to be sustainable. And customers who are going to keep pushing for it after this is done, will just find themselves in it in the next demand turn or the demand strength or even slight upside. For me, the focus is a productive engagement with the customer, where they are confident in their demand signal, and I’m confident in my investment in order to meet that. The short-term cancellation, all of that, I think, is going to be a thing of the past. And that’s going to be the difference between a strategic customer and a non-strategic customer it’s the ones that we are able to run a healthy and profitable, but more importantly, a predictable business with. That’s where our focus has been. And part of it is part of those long-term agreements. Now when I look at the inventory for customers who have done it, I’ve done it in my past lives, where some customers will work with us on what we call a BCP, business continuity plan, which includes some inventory with us, but more inventory with them that we have visibility to, where they will hold it, they will order it, they have 2 months or so of it. And we just have to make sure it’s replenished. We’ve done that, a lot of it with our Japanese strategic customers. And I’m hoping that we’ll start expanding for European and North American customers as well.
Mark Lipacis: That makes lot of sense. Thanks, Hassane. Very helpful.
Operator: Your next question comes from William Stein with Truist Securities. Your line is open.
William Stein: Thank you taking my questions and congratulations on a very strong outlook. Hassane, in the past, we’ve talked about this idea of a split between you’re relatively more, let’s say, specialized or unique products versus ones that are somewhat more commoditized in nature. And I think your prior responses around this have been that it’s not so straightforward. It’s not just looking at margins, you have to look at parts and, in particular, parts by end market. And I’m wondering if you’ve had the opportunity to complete that analysis and maybe help us understand a little bit better about what the split might look like today and going forward in terms of the balance between those two categories?
Hassane El-Khoury: So the answer to your question is, yes, I have had a lot of opportunities to look at it. We’re in almost call it, the last stages of review, where I have a 2 week-long kind of wrapping up the strategic plans and the strategic reviews. But what you said is true for us not just on the margin, because you have to look margin and our ability to manufacture it at a very aggressive cost. You can have a product today at a low-margin that we are targeting in automotive. It is valued product. And the margin impact is because it is not running efficiently as far as cost structures through our manufacturing footprint. So by consolidating and rationalizing the manufacturing, that’s going to give an uplift to those specific products. So before I rush and I say low margin, kill it or move away from it, I have to be able to make sure that we have a benchmark cost in order to make those assessments. And then the decision for us here is do we act on the product right away? Or do we fix the cost and keep the product, and that’s part of a strategic review. I can’t tell you at this point, how much of the products fall in which bucket that’s going to be part of the work we are going to be finalizing as we get ready for Analyst Day. But I just wanted to give you a preview of the mindset that I have going into that work.
William Stein: I appreciate that. And maybe a follow-up along the same lines, in terms of not getting a quantified size or split today, do you think the size might be big enough to take a significant action that doesn’t look like just sort of letting it, pricing yourself out of the market or letting it fall off the income statement over time and something that could be more of a strategic action like monetizing the asset through a JV or something like that?
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes, absolutely. I mean if you think about – once you disposition your assets and categories, you have a harvest core and growth categories. We have to look at what we – how do we disposition the assets. Pricing yourself out of the market or exiting or EO-eling  and shutting down a manufacturing site that supports those products is one side of it. But monetizing the assets is, of course, something that is on the table that we’re going to be looking at. All options are out, and we’re going to do the best thing for the company as far as balancing cash flow and balancing manufacturing footprint.
Operator: Okay. Thanks guys.
Operator: This concludes the Q&A session for today’s call. I’d now like to turn the call back over to Hassane El-Khoury, President and CEO.
Hassane El-Khoury: Thank you all for joining us today. I’d like to thank our worldwide teams for stepping up to help drive our transformation, which has already started delivering favorable results. We remain focused on our execution as we navigate the current market conditions, and I look forward to seeing you all at our Analyst Day on August 5. Thank you.
Operator: This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect."
3504,ON,1,2020,2020-05-11 22:12:05,"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by, and welcome to the ON Semiconductor First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Parag Agarwal. You may begin.

Given the current restrictions on travel and gatherings due to COVID-19 pandemic, the previously announced Strategic Business Update scheduled for August 18 in New York has been postponed. We will provide you a new date and location for the event as we get further clarity. Now, let me turn it over to Bernard Gutmann, who will provide an overview of our first quarter 2020 results. Bernard? 
Bernard Gutmann: Thank you, Parag, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. As is the case with most of our peers, our results for the first quarter of 2020 and outlook for the second quarter have been meaningfully impacted by COVID-19. Although our near-term results have been impacted by the pandemic, we believe that long-term drivers of our business remain intact. We expect to show progress towards our target financial model as global macroeconomic environment recovers and we continue to implement structural changes to drive margin expansion and higher free cash flow. In the face of challenging business conditions, we have taken measures that should strengthen our balance sheet and free cash flow. These steps include the drawdown of approximately $1.17 billion from our revolving line of credit. This step was taken out of abundance of caution to ensure that we have adequate level of liquidity, should the global macroeconomic conditions unexpectedly and sharply deteriorate due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, we have taken certain tactical and temporary actions, which should result in cost savings of approximately $50 million throughout the rest of the year. These measures include a reduction in executive salaries and compensation for board members, the suspension of our 401(k) company match program in the US, deferral of merit salary and wage increases and staggered furloughs of certain employees for three weeks during the year. The cost savings of $50 million throughout the rest of 2020 are in addition to those from our $115 million restructuring programs announced earlier. We anticipate that our capital expenditures for 2020 will be largely focused on enabling our 300-millimeter fab in East Fishkill. At this time, we expect capital expenditure of approximately $425 million, in 2020. Furthermore, to preserve our balance sheet strength, we do not intend to buy back our shares until business conditions improve. Now, let me provide you additional details on our first quarter 2020 results. Total revenue for the first quarter of 2020 was $1.278 billion, a decrease of 8% as compared to revenue of $1.387 billion in the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decline in revenue was primarily driven by slowdown in macroeconomic activity and supply constraints resulting from COVID - government-related mandated lockdown measures around the world. We drastically curtailed operations at few of our factories to ensure the safety of our employees and to comply with local regulations. GAAP net loss for the first quarter was $0.03 per diluted share as compared to a net income of $0.27 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP net income for first quarter of 2020 was $0.10 per diluted share as compared to $0.43 per diluted share in the first quarter of 2019. GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin for the first quarter of 2020 was 31.5% as compared to 37% in the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decline in gross margin was primarily driven by lower revenue and significantly lower level of factory utilization, as mentioned earlier. As required by GAAP, we recorded a period charge of approximately $19 million due to the significant underutilization of our factory network in the first quarter. This charge also includes the impact of a short strike at our Belgium fab. This strike was related to our announced plan to divest the fab. As utilization of our factory network improves with expected improvement in business conditions, potentially, in the second half of the year, we will not be required to take underutilization-related period charges. As a result, we could see a step-function increase in our gross margin. First quarter of 2020 gross margin was further impacted by approximately $3 million of charges as a result of higher logistics and freight costs. Our GAAP operating margin for the first quarter of 2020 was 1.5% as compared to 12.9% in the first quarter of 2019. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter of 2020 was 6.6% as compared to 15.5% in the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was largely driven by lower revenue and gross margin. GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $384 million as compared to $334 million in the first quarter of 2019. First quarter GAAP operating expenses include approximately $31 million associated with restructuring programs announced earlier. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the first quarter were $319 million as compared to $290 (sic) [$299] million in the first quarter of 2019. The year-over-year increase in non-GAAP operating expenses was primarily due to the acquisition of Quantenna. First quarter free cash flow was $34 million, and operating cash flow was $166 million. During the first quarter, we used approximately $65 million to repurchase 3.6 million shares of our common stock. Capital expenditures during the first quarter were $132 million, which equate to a capital intensity of 10.3%. Given our - the current macroeconomic environment, we are directing most of our capital expenditures towards enabling our 300-millimeter East Fishkill - fab at East Fishkill. As indicated earlier, we expect capital expenditures for 2020 to be approximately $425 million. We exited the first quarter of 2020 with cash and cash equivalents of $1.982 billion as compared to $894 million at the end of the fourth quarter of 2019. At this time, with cash balance of approximately $2 billion, we are very comfortable with our liquidity position. At the end of the first quarter, days of inventory on hand were 131 days, up by 8 days as compared to 123 days in the fourth quarter of 2019. The increase in days of inventory was driven primarily by a lower expected revenue. Distribution inventory increased slightly in terms of weeks of inventory due to lower resales. In terms of dollars, distribution inventory declined quarter-over-quarter. Now, let me provide you an update on the performance of our business units, starting with Power Solutions Group, or PSG. Revenue for PSG for the first quarter of 2020 was $624 million. Revenue for the Advanced Solutions Group, previously known as Analog Solutions Group, for the first quarter was $467 million. And revenue for our Intelligent Sensing Group was $187 million. Now, I would like to turn the call over to Keith Jackson for additional comments on the business environment. Keith?
Keith Jackson: Thanks, Bernard. At the outset, I thank all of our employees for their dedication in supporting our first responders and customers in the face of very challenging conditions. Our employees went well beyond what is required of them to ensure supply of critical components for ventilators and other medical equipment. In countries where governments instituted lockdown measures to control the spread of the virus, many of our manufacturing and support teams stayed at the factories to ensure supply of critical components to our customers. Safety of our employees is of paramount importance to us. Consistent with that commitment, we have suspended all non-essential travel. Globally, the teams are working remotely in compliance with local rules and are following strict social distancing guidelines in case they are required to visit a work facility. Our IT organization has done an outstanding job of enabling thousands of our employees to work remotely. We are actively supporting local communities by donating medical supplies and personal protective equipment and matching employee donations. We continue to step up on short notice. When the state of California requested one of our customers for a quick turnaround on ventilators, our supply chain and manufacturing teams responded with extreme urgency to provide critical components immediately. These teams, like many others in ON Semiconductor, exemplify the spirit of collaboration and being a good corporate citizen. Despite the current challenges, key secular megatrends and long-term drivers of our business remain intact. In automotive, we expect the key secular trends, such as ADAS, vehicle electrification and fuel efficiency, will continue along a steep upward trajectory. In industrial, we expect to see acceleration in factory and warehouse automation, robotics, energy efficiency and personal medical devices. In cloud-power, along with growth in data-centric applications, we expect to see increased spending on servers and communications infrastructure as companies put in place a robust infrastructure to enable a remote and distributed workforce. We believe that the global community should be able to overcome the current health crisis in a timely manner. And we expect business activity to improve soon thereafter. While we are taking measures to mitigate the impact of soft business conditions, our long-term goals and strategy remain unchanged. We are aggressively working to enable our 300-millimeter manufacturing capability. Our product development programs and customer engagement on key strategic projects are continuing as planned. We continue to strengthen our leadership in - by investing in the fastest-growing segments of automotive, industrial and cloud-power end markets. We expect that our [ph] contact in these will continue to grow at a healthy pace, despite the current crisis. Along with continued execution on our key strategic initiatives, we are making structural and tactical changes to align our business with current conditions and to drive long-term growth in profitability and free cash flow. Our business realignment programs remain on track. We have taken actions to complete the previously announced restructuring programs. These programs should result in the cost savings of approximately $115 million a year. As announced earlier, we should be able to achieve these savings by the fourth quarter of 2020 on a run rate basis. We believe that, with these actions, the company is well positioned for accelerated progress towards our target model as the global macroeconomic environment recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. As mentioned during the previous results conference call, we are making strong progress towards ramping production at our 300-millimeter fab at East Fishkill. At this point, we are tracking significantly ahead of schedule, and we now expect to begin initial production in the middle of 2020. The results and yields of initial wafer runs have been spectacular. Based on our experience thus far with the East Fishkill fab, we are even more confident that transition of production to this fab will be a major inflection point for our manufacturing cost structure as we consolidate our front-end network. Let me now comment on the current business environment. On the demand front, it is a mixed picture. Demand from automotive end market has been impacted severely due to the closure of manufacturing plants and extremely challenging global macroeconomic conditions. We expect the automotive weakness to continue till automotive manufacturing plants reopen and global production restarts at least at a moderate pace. We are seeing good strength in a few end markets in the second quarter. Most notably, activity in the industrial end market appears to be strong across most geographies. Server and 5G infrastructure-related demand continues to grow at a healthy pace. Demand from smartphone and consumer end markets continues to be soft due to massive slowdown in global macroeconomic activity. From a geographic perspective, after slowdown early in the first quarter, demand from China has improved meaningfully. Japan is another area of moderate strength. Demand from the US and Europe has significantly softened due to pause in most economic activities because of government-mandated quarantines and other regulatory action, aimed at reducing the spread of COVID-19. Both in the US and Europe, automotive is an area of conspicuous weakness. It appears that customers are preparing for a recovery in the second half and are placing orders to ensure supply. At this time, we are seeing significantly higher order activity for the second half of the year as compared to that in the first half of the year. The orders are broad-based in terms of end markets, geographies and channels. During the first quarter, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected our operations and impacted our ability to supply products to many of our customers. These disruptions have continued into the current quarter. And we expect to resolve them by the end of this week. Early in the first quarter, our manufacturing facilities in China were closed for longer than planned for Lunar New Year holidays in compliance with government mandates. Following the extended shutdown, our China factories resumed production and are now running at close to full utilization. Subsequently, in March, our facilities in Malaysia and Philippines, where a sizeable part of our back-end operations are located, were severely impacted due to lockdown mandates by various governments. Our Malaysia and Philippines manufacturing plants ran significantly below capacity for most of March. Underutilization of these facilities continued in April and into May. Most of our facilities worldwide are expected to be running at required level of utilization by the end of this week. Now, I’ll provide details of the progress in our various end markets for the first quarter of 2020. Revenue for the automotive market in the first quarter was $439 million and represented 34% of our revenue in the first quarter. First quarter automotive revenue declined 6% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline in automotive market was primarily driven by closure of automotive production factories in various parts of the world and supply constraints driven by reduced level of operations at our partners’ manufacturing facilities. We saw weakness in China automotive and industrial markets earlier in the first quarter, but business activity has since picked up as factories have reopened in China. Currently, we are seeing significant weakness in the US and European automotive markets due to closure of automotive factories. Based on comments by major automakers, it appears that many European factories are now gradually restarting. In the US, automakers are planning to reopen factories starting in the latter half of May. Based on third-party reports, we expect global light vehicle production units to decline by approximately 20% to 25% year-over-year in 2020. Despite a massive decline in light vehicle production units, we expect semiconductor content in automotive applications to continue to increase at a healthy pace. Key secular megatrends driving increased semiconductor content in automotive applications, such as vehicle electrification, ADAS, fuel efficiency and LED lighting, remain intact. And we are well positioned through our technology leadership and customer relationships to capitalize on these trends. During the first quarter, we secured a major design win for ADAS image sensors with a Japanese OEM. This OEM is one of the largest automakers in the world. This win underscores our global leadership in ADAS image sensors and highlights customer confidence in our technology in a high safety critical application. Our momentum for Silicon Carbide and silicon power products for electric vehicles continues to increase at a rapid pace. With a solid product portfolio of Silicon Carbide devices and modules, we are seeing a strong growth in revenue from electric vehicles. At the same time, the breadth and depth of our engagement with leading participants in the electric vehicle ecosystem is expanding very significantly. We expect to see strong revenue growth in our IGBT modules for EV traction inverters as our design wins ramp in China this year. Extension of subsidies for electric vehicles in China till 2022 is likely to be a significant boost for our Silicon Carbide and IGBT business in China. Our power products continue to grow in many automotive applications. Electrification of various vehicle systems to conserve energy and to improve performance is a key driver of increasing content of power devices in vehicles. During the first quarter, we also secured a major design win for our mid-voltage MOSFETs for 48-volt systems. Revenue in the second quarter of 2020 for the automotive end market is expected to be down steeply quarter-over-quarter due to closure of most US and European automotive factories for a significant part of the quarter. The Industrial end market, which includes military, aerospace and medical, contributed revenue of $315 million in the first quarter. The industrial end market represented 25% of our revenue in the first quarter. Year-over-year, our first quarter industrial revenue declined 12%. This decline was driven by a swift and sharp decline in global industrial activity and supply constraints due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite challenging macroeconomic conditions, we continue to make progress towards our key strategic initiatives. In industrial power segment, momentum for our Silicon Carbide and silicon devices remained robust. We are seeing strong customer interest for our Silicon Carbide devices for fast-charging stations for electric vehicles. During the first quarter, we secured an important design win for our high-voltage super-junction MOSFETs for electric vehicle charging stations. On the medical front, our teams are working very hard to support the medical community in the fight against COVID-19. The entire organization is focused on supporting increased demand for components for critical medical equipment such as ventilators, infusion pumps, patient monitoring systems, cardiac assist systems and medical imaging equipment. Our engagement with e-commerce customers is growing at a rapid pace, and we expect e-commerce related applications will be a strong driver of our industrial image sensor business. We believe that growth in our e-commerce related business will be driven by increasing e-commerce volumes, increasing warehouse automation and adoption of delivery robots. Through our early engagement with industry leaders in e-commerce, we have built a strong design win pipeline for our CMOS image sensors for warehouse automation and delivery robots. Revenue in the second quarter of 2020 for the industrial end market is expected to be up quarter-over-quarter, driven by strong recovery in the demand from all regions. The communications end market, which includes both networking and wireless, contributed revenue of $254 million in the first quarter and represented 20% of our revenue during the first quarter. First quarter communications revenue declined 1% year-over-year. The decline was primarily due to weakness in our smartphone-related business. We saw solid year-over-year growth in our infrastructure business, driven largely by 5G. We further solidified our position in the 5G infrastructure market by winning new designs for medium-voltage MOSFETs. Revenue in the second quarter of 2020 for the communications end market is expected to be down quarter-over-quarter, primarily due to softness in the smartphone market. We expect our 5G infrastructure to grow at a robust pace quarter-over-quarter in the second quarter. The computing end market contributed revenue of $136 million in the first quarter. The computing end market represented 11% of our revenue in the first quarter. First quarter computing revenue declined 7% year-over-year, primarily due to our selective participation in the client-related business. Our server business grew at a very impressive rate year-over-year. We experienced better-than-expected results in our server business as corporations rushed to augment their IT infrastructure to support a remote workforce. Our power management products for server processors and IGBTs for uninterruptable power supplies were key drivers of strength in our server business. Revenue in the second quarter of 2020 for the computing end market is expected to be up quarter-over-quarter. We expect growth in both server and client parts of our computing business. The consumer end market contributed revenue of $134 million in the first quarter. The consumer end market represented 10% of our revenue in the first quarter. First quarter consumer revenue declined by 17% year-over-year, and the year-over-year decline was due to broad-based weakness in consumer electronics market due to the COVID-19 pandemic and our selective participation in this market. Revenue in the second quarter of 2020 for the consumer end market is expected to be down quarter-over-quarter. In summary, COVID-19 has had a sizable impact on both demand for our products and our ability to supply. We expect that, during the second quarter, by the end of this week, our supply capabilities will improve significantly. Based on order patterns, it appears that our customers are planning for a recovery in the second half of the year, and we are encouraged by gradual resumption of global - activity globally. Despite current challenges due to COVID-19 pandemic, our long-term goals and strategy remains unchanged. We have taken previously announced restructuring actions to optimize our investments and cost structure, and we are well positioned to make accelerated progress towards our target model as the global macroeconomic environment recovers. We continue to work aggressively to enable our 300-millimeter fab in East Fishkill, and we remain on track to start our 300-millimeter production by the middle of this year. Despite the current macroeconomic disruptions, key secular megatrends driving our business remain intact, and we are upbeat about our medium- to long-term prospects. We are focused on the fastest growing end markets of the semiconductor industry. And with our design wins, we expect that our content in automotive, industrial and cloud-power applications will continue to grow. Now, I’d like to turn it back over to Bernard for forward-looking guidance. Bernard?
Bernard Gutmann: Thank you, Keith. Before I get into the details, let me highlight the key drivers of the guidance for the second quarter. Our guidance for the second quarter is based on the assumption that the global macroeconomic environment will not further deteriorate due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We will likely continue to face operational and logistical challenges due to government mandates. Also, this is a period of extreme uncertainty and volatility, and future results of our business will not only depend on the course of the pandemic, but also on government actions and the pace of recovery in global macroeconomic activity. Therefore, our ability to forecast our business performance is limited. And the range of our guidance for various financial metrics for the second quarter is wider than what we have provided historically. Based on product booking trends, backlog levels and estimated turn levels, we anticipate the total ON Semiconductor revenue is expected to be in the range of $1.1 billion to $1.26 billion in the second quarter of 2020. As noted earlier, we will likely continue to face operational and logistical challenges due to government mandates in the second quarter. For the second quarter of 2020, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin between 29% and 31%. Lower revenue in the second quarter as compared to that of the first quarter is the primary driver of the quarter-over-quarter decline in gross margin for the second quarter. We expect to record marginally lower period underutilization charge in the second quarter as compared to that of the first quarter. We expect total GAAP operating expenses of $340 million to $360 million. Our GAAP operating expenses include amortization of intangibles, restructuring, asset impairments and other charges which are expected to be between $43 million and $47 million. We expect total non-GAAP operating expenses of $297 million to $313 million in the second quarter. We anticipate second quarter of 2020 GAAP net other income and expenses including interest expense will be in the $42 million to $45 million which includes non-cash interest expense of $9 million to $10 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP net other income and expenses including interest expense will be $33 million to $35 million. Net cash paid for income taxes in the second quarter of 2020 is expected to be $10 million to $13 million. For 2020, we expect cash paid for taxes to be in the range of $50 million to $60 million. We expect total capital expenditures of $80 million to $100 million in the second quarter of 2020. We are currently targeting an overwhelming proportion of our CapEx for enabling our 300-millimeter fab at an accelerated pace. For 2020, we expect total capital expenditures of approximately $425 million. We also expect share-based compensation of $19 million to $21 million in the second quarter of 2020, of which approximately $2 million is expected to be in cost of goods sold and the remaining amount is expected to be in operating expenses. This expense is included in our non-GAAP financial results. Our GAAP diluted share count for the second quarter of 2020 is expected to be 413 million shares based on our current stock price. Further details on share count and earnings per share calculations are provided regularly in our quarterly and annual reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K, respectively. With that, I would like to start the Q&A session. Thank you. And, Doranda, please open up the line for questions.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I guess, first, on the revenue side of things, can I get a little more color on what you’re seeing in the near-term bookings and how you’re guiding versus that? Because, I guess, the impression I have from your script is more of that you’re not seeing as much strength as some of your peers in the very near term but you’re more confident in the back half of the year. And it seems like a bit of a dichotomy where they’re guiding well below currently strong bookings for fear that the macro economy is actually going to weaken further, where your guidance seems to take the opposite tact.
Keith Jackson: Yeah, interesting comparison. I think the two things that impact that, one, when we’re talking about the revenue strength, the impact that we have in the Philippines and Malaysia is perhaps more significant than much of our competition. And so, you’re hearing us talk about supply constraints in the near term. On the demand side, the automotive piece is very significant for us, but it is picking back up for Q3. And so, again, I don’t have any specific comparatives other than to say that what we’ve seen is more demand than we can service in the second quarter. And the rate of that pace is going up significantly in the third quarter. But we think we’ll be able to have all of the supply constraints behind us.
Ross Seymore: Thanks for that. And then, I guess, my second question would be on the gross margin side of things. It continues to be a source of headwind. I think, directionally, everybody understands why. But the magnitude is bigger than I even thought. So, I guess, kind of, two points on that. Weren’t there a number of one-time issues that hit you in the fourth quarter and first quarter that should have been a bit of a tailwind in the second quarter? And then, as we think about that second half trajectory on gross margin, are there some structural changes that are going to kick in? Or what’s the stair step you’re talking about? Is it just utilization popping up?
Bernard Gutmann: Thank you, Ross. So, you’re correct, we did have some one-time items that affected us in Q4. And basically, those have been resolved. We don’t see those anymore, same with the OSA that will go away in Q2. Definitely, as Keith mentioned earlier, we were substantially affected by the abnormally low utilization for the periods in which we had lockdowns in our factories and that caused us to get - to book the abnormal one-time $19 million hit to our gross margin, which we expect will continue maybe a little bit marginally lower, but will continue throughout Q2. Once that goes away, we’re back to eliminating that and gross margin should step up nicely if, obviously, the markets continue behaving. And our fall-through should be pretty nice as we go back to doing that. So, it is primarily the fact that we have had the significant hit to our operations to the supply constraints.
Ross Seymore: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citigroup. Your line is open.
Christopher Brett Danely: Hey. Thanks, guys. Just to follow up on Ross’ question. So, if the revenue levels don’t get back to 2019 levels for quite some time, what’s the plan to drive to the gross margin target, especially considering the manufacturing capacity you have right now?
Bernard Gutmann: Well, we have already announced the intended sale of our Belgium fab, and we will continue doing that fab. And if things continue getting worse, there will be other actions that would be along the same line. We continue to focus on cash and we also - not that much on the gross margin but across the spectrum, we took some temporary actions to shore up our numbers. We had announced the $115 million previously of permanent restructuring actions. And then, we announced this time another $50 million of various tactical actions that will shore up the cash. If conditions continue worsening, we’ll be ready to take more actions.
Christopher Brett Danely: Thanks, Bernard. And then, as my follow-up, just to go along with the restructuring actions, can you give us a sense of how these things are supposed to trend in terms of OpEx versus cost of goods for the rest of this year? And then, will there still be some savings next year? Or will you realize all the savings by the end of this year?
Bernard Gutmann: For the $115 million that we announced earlier, we expect to achieve the [ph] exiting diversity in Q4. It is primarily OpEx driven. There is a little bit - a small piece of it that goes to comps, but most of it is OpEx driven. The $50 million of temporary actions is by nature of being temporary is just between now and the end of the year is about close to $50 million. Heavier focused on OpEx, but there is still a good participation of COGS that will help us.
Christopher Brett Danely: Okay. Great. Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Raymond James. Your line is open.
Chris Caso: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Just a question on the supply disruptions and you talked about that was pretty severe in the second quarter. What’s - one, what’s the status of that - I’m sorry, as you go into the second quarter, what’s the status of those supply disruptions? What’s the percentage of your capacity that’s back online? And then, naturally, when you have those supply disruptions, there’s some incentive on the part of customers to layer in some orders they might not necessarily need. What’s your visibility on that? I know it’s always something difficult to judge. But how are you, I guess, judging down the orders that you have to avoid the potential of double ordering?
Keith Jackson: Yeah. So, the supply disruptions have improved as we got into May. They were still quite severe in April, and we don’t expect to be at full capacity until the end of this week. So, a very sizable part of the second quarter has already been impacted. Relative to the demand things, I will just tell you that the orders we have make sense based on the end market data that we’re getting. We don’t see anything that’s abnormal relative to what’s going on in the end market. So, the areas that are weak are weak in our backlog and the areas that have picked up primarily due to China coming back online are the ones that have picked up.
Chris Caso: Okay. Thank you. As a follow-up, with regard to CapEx - and I understand there’s some elevated CapEx right now because of what you’re doing with the Fishkill facility. Can you talk about how long that continues? At what point is the spending on Fishkill over? And then, once that’s the case, what’s a more normalized level of CapEx spending that we should expect when Fishkill is over and presumably as we go into 2021?
Bernard Gutmann: So, basically, we have said, once we made the acquisition of this Fishkill that our long-term goal is 6% to 7% on CapEx. We will be moving towards that target as time goes by. I’m not sure it will be exactly at the beginning of 2021, but we’ll be moving towards that as we go in time.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Raji Gill with Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Rajvindra Gill: Yes. Thank you. A question on the - this comment about the gross margin stepping up significantly in the third quarter. How are you stepping up? Wanted to kind of discuss that in a little bit more detail, obviously, the underutilization charges will go away. But what else would drive that step-up function? Are you expecting a better mix shift in the third quarter, if auto comes back online? Any other details in terms of what you think will be the drivers for the step-up in margins in the back half of the year?
Bernard Gutmann: So, as Keith mentioned earlier, we are seeing better demands for the back half. So, we expect the help from incremental revenue and the fall-through should be pretty nice. We also should be seeing mix as our markets that drive better gross margin should be coming back up particularly [ph] on holding.
Rajvindra Gill: And in terms of the end markets, you had mentioned that Europe and the US are starting to bring back manufacturing online. This is based on the commentary from those companies that you cited. In terms of tangible evidence, from your perspective, on the automotive side, how would you characterize the orders in automotive as we go into kind of - if you look at the third quarter? And then, also, have there been any delays of more advanced ADAS programs because of the drop in demand? Any thoughts there in terms of the current ADAS programs or the EV programs that are on track?
Keith Jackson: Yeah. We saw a very steep decline in demand from automotive, as we got through the first quarter and into the first part of the second quarter. That free fall, if you will, has levelled off and is no longer declining. So, that’s certainly a good sign. And then, we have specific requests from our large OEMS, letting us know that they are expecting to have more demand in the second half. And we need to be ready. From demand on things like ADAS and electrification, those continued quite on track. And what we’re seeing is that some companies are using this dislocation in the market to kind of reposition themselves upscale with both their electric vehicles and their ADAS content. So, we’re actually seeing potentially an accelerator in those two parts of automotive, as it recovers.
Rajvindra Gill: And just last question on the smartphone side. You mentioned the drop in smartphones going to be offset partially by 5G infrastructure. There’s been an indication that smartphones are recovering in China. I just wanted to get your thoughts on your - maybe your dollar content opportunity in smartphones, any view there in terms of how we think about the second half.
Keith Jackson: So, dollar content is around $9 for smartphone. We have indeed seen a pickup in China, but only with the China brands at this stage. But we are expecting to see global brands launching new models in the second half. So, our expectation is that the second half will be much better for smartphones than the first half.
Rajvindra Gill: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. Your line is open. [ph] Checking to see if you’re on mute, sir.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh: Hi. Sorry about that. I know you guys mentioned some long lead orders that came in for the second half. Just wondering if it’s slanted disproportionately due to automotive or industrial or how you’re seeing that.
Keith Jackson: Yeah. It’s very broad in the second half. Demand there is looking good. We just mentioned smartphones look like they’re going to be up. Automotive is up from a very low number so it’s - I don’t want to get too excited. But the industrial piece continues to build. And our server and cloud business continues to show great strength.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh: Got it. And on the 5G side, I think you mentioned it’s growing sequentially into the second quarter. Is that infrastructure [ph] or base station growth coming from China? Or is it - or do you see a second half pickup in the US, Europe, et cetera? Thanks.
Keith Jackson: So, China is certainly the strongest pickup there. But we really never saw much of a decline outside of China. So, it continues to be healthy.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh: Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna International. Your line is open.
Christopher Rolland: Hi, guys. I know we might be a ways away from M&A, but it’s been a focus of yours in the past. And you guys have previously talked about doing something more strategic or higher gross margin. But given the underutilizations and growing footprint that you guys have, have you shifted at all towards a belief that you need more volume across your infrastructure? And maybe if you can talk about any other levers you can pull there in terms of underutilization. You’ve talked about reducing your older footprint. But how about bringing more external internal, for example? Is that [indiscernible]? Thanks
Keith Jackson: So, I guess, two questions on that. From an M&A perspective, we’re not sure this is a prudent time. And so, really nothing new to report there. And as far as utilizing the network, we clearly are looking at bringing more manufacturing inside. Those are actions that are underway and should help us in the second half of this year.
Christopher Rolland: Got it. And then, on to Fishkill, that was some nice commentary you guys had around ramping yields there. I guess, since things are ramping a little bit better than expected, how does this compare to your original expectation? Are there any changes to the model positively? And then, secondly, what’s going to be your strategy since yields are so good in terms of bringing bulk volume from other fabs? Are you going to bring them immediately and leave those other fabs somewhat empty? Or is it going to be more of a controlled process in which you’re doing it one fab at a time? Thank you.
Keith Jackson: Yes. So, a couple of commentary, one, the products we’re putting into EFK first are the power products supporting most of our automotive and cloud-power type applications. And so, the good news is those volumes continue to grow. And so, we feel pretty good about that. We have intended to ramp that and not empty other factories, and we continue to think that we’ll be able to keep our factories full while ramping EFK. And from on track or ahead of schedule perspective, it’s roughly looking like we’re about six months in advance somewhere we thought we would be and we work with customers that are specifically growing power content with us to qualify those factories and start running here in a matter of weeks.
Christopher Rolland: Thanks, Keith.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis with B. Riley. Your line is open.
Craig Ellis: Yeah. Thanks for that. And I’ll just ask a follow-up to the last question. So, if you’re getting good engagement with customers on East Fishkill, Keith, what would you expect the percent of ON’s production to be out of that facility exiting this year? And if you have another six quarters under the belt exiting calendar 2021, what’s the percent of total sales that could come out of East Fishkill with its lower cost footprint than what you have elsewhere?
Keith Jackson: So, I don’t actually have prepared quarter-by-quarter breakdown for you, Craig. We talked about having the ability to do about $2 billion of revenue from the factory. That won’t happen in 2020 or even 2021. But by the time we get to 2023, we should be able to do that.
Craig Ellis: Okay. That’s helpful. And then, auto obviously has been a big focus on this call as it has many others, given the impact to units this year. As we look at auto, I think we’re probably in the second quarter going to be tracking about $120-ish million below prior highs. How much of that volume can be made up with increased content over the next year or two, Keith? And how much of what had been automotive volumes in the factory network will need to be absorbed by things like cloud power or other growth initiatives or areas where you’ve got secular content in? Thank you.
Keith Jackson: Yeah. So, the - I mentioned before the things we’re watching carefully are the electric vehicle ramps in China. They put back incentives to focus there. The content, as you know, is several hundred dollars higher in electric vehicle. And so, the simple answer is, if they really ramp mostly electric as we go forward in China, there’s a substantial opportunity to overcome any unit losses. And then, ADAS, similar kinds of situation there. They’re becoming - consumers are more safety conscious. And so, we’re seeing the contents there go up $20, $30 a car at a time. And so, I think the question will be, as we come out of this downturn, what the strategy is going to be? And right now, at least, we’re looking at more electric vehicles and more focus on safety. So, we think most of that, if not all of that, will be offset as we exit this year.
Craig Ellis: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Ambrish Srivastava with BMO. Your line is open.
Ambrish Srivastava: Thanks very much. Thanks for taking my question. I just wanted to come back to the gross margin side, Bernard. And I’m sorry you were cutting out when you were answering the question, at least for me. I wanted to understand the bridge between Q1 and Q2. So, how much of the costs would go away? How much of it is one-time in nature? And then, kind of, related to the recovery part is you talked about fall-through and you’re also talking about a step-function increase and then there’s a third factor coming in which is your 300-millimeter fab. So, what’s the right way to think about fall-through as margins recover as a result of revenues coming back? That would be helpful. So, A, just kind of help us bridge the gap; and, B, how should we think about fall-through? Thank you.
Bernard Gutmann: So, the fall - the bridge for Q1 to Q2 is pretty straightforward. It’s mostly the decremental fall-through of 50% on the revenue going from $1.278 billion to $1.180 billion at the midpoint. The one-off period charges that we saw in Q1 will continue in Q2. Keith mentioned the fact that we had during the month of April continued shelter-in-place mandates, government mandates in most of our locations. And then, we expect to be getting close to being out of that by the end of this week. So, it has had a significant effect in this quarter, which is going to be similar in nature - maybe a tad bit less, but similar in nature to what we had in Q1. That’s the one that when we go into Q3, assuming that there is - that the - all these supplier issues, i.e. the mandates from the government have - would have been eliminated, that approximately $20 million goes away completely as we go into Q3. And then, we have the normal fall-through on whatever revenue comes through. That’s the high level...
Ambrish Srivastava: And how does fall-through change because 300-millimeter should be helping you? And this is not a question for this year. Obviously, you’re just starting to ramp it. But steady state, how should 300-millimeter have a positive impact for margins?
Bernard Gutmann: We definitely see that the unit costs of - for [indiscernible] will be better [ph] in this year. Obviously, it will be depending on the speed of the qualification from our customers and - as we go into that and it’s more a longer-term 2021, 2022 timeframe [indiscernible] expect any significant direct impact in 2020 as it relates to gross margin. And we’re also relying a lot on what we’re seeing others have done as they go into 300-millimeter and we expect that we’ll have something similar in nature.
Ambrish Srivastava: Okay. Thank you. And my quick follow-up, Keith, sorry, on your comment about Q-over-Q increase for the second quarter, I was a little bit surprised about industrials, especially given the macro backdrop. Is that primarily related to China recovery or sell in? Just - can you please expand on that, please? Thank you.
Keith Jackson: Yeah. China is certainly the biggest driver of the increase there. As you remember, in the end of last year, it had been severely curtailed in China. It was very, very weak. And so, that has been recovering. We also have the medical business in that industrial category, and they’ve certainly seen an uptick globally. And so, those are kind of the big ones there.
Ambrish Srivastava: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is open.
Matthew Ramsay: Yes. Thank you very much. Good morning. I just wanted to follow up, Keith, on a couple of other questions that folks asked about assumptions for manufacturing at East Fishkill. Just assuming, given what’s going on in the macro, that revenue levels for the industry and the whole company will be maybe lower exiting when you take - coming into the point where you take over full ownership of the facility, are you guys basically kind of saying that, through different optimizations of the rest of your factory network and a little bit more insourcing, that the overall volume and dollar content of what you might put through Fishkill at the point that you take over ownership, we should just assume it’s roughly what it was when you signed the agreement? Or are there any sort of big picture changes to those assumptions that we should think about, given all that’s going on? Thank you.
Keith Jackson: Well, the way we look at things is kind of twofold. One, the amount of power that we’ve got as a percentage of the company, we expect to continue to expand for all the reasons we’ve been explaining. And so, when we take over in 2023, we would certainly expect that power piece of the business to have grown substantially. We don’t think COVID is with us forever. And then, secondly, from a factory perspective, I mean, we did do an expansion, frankly, because our outlook for the growth in electric vehicles and the growth in the 5G infrastructure and the cloud-power was going to be such that specific set of technology nodes would need to have expansion. So, really nothing has changed on that perspective from the 2023 look, but certainly has had a major interruption here in 2020.
Matthew Ramsay: Got it. That’s clear and helpful. Just wanted to follow up, obviously, on - Bernard, on the OpEx side. There’s some actions you guys have laid out. Anything in particular to call out in R&D that might be changes to different programs that we should pay attention to? Or is it no real change to what you guys announced last quarter and just some, obviously, additional belt tightening, given what’s going on globally? Thank you.
Bernard Gutmann: So, no additional from what we announced last quarter. We did - we aligned some of our investments to make sure we are targeting the highest growth markets and the ones we think about. But most of these additional actions we built are more tactical in nature and therefore don’t change our view of R&D.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Gary Mobley: Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. In the interest of time, I’ll post both of my question now. I know, in the past, you were planning on becoming more vertically integrated in power devices with some Silicon Carbide materials. I wonder if that’s still in the cards for you guys. And, Bernard, could you give us some, I guess, benchmark on what the OpEx run rate can be as we exit the year? Is $290 million in that fourth quarter the right number to think about?
Keith Jackson: Okay. On the continued vertical integration, we continue to be on track there, and we will have a network, as I mentioned before, of internal supply and external supply for the wafering as we do with silicon today. And so, we’ll continue to invest in that and are making good progress.
Bernard Gutmann: And on the OpEx question, we do intend to continue reducing our OpEx in absolute dollars throughout the year from our current levels and from our Q2 midpoint of $305 million. So, the - with the actions - the temporary impairment actions that we’re talking about, $290 million seems to be an appropriate number.
Gary Mobley: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. The operational and logistic challenges in Southeast Asia are certainly impacting your lead times. [ph] I seem to recall that normalized lead times for the team is around 8 to 12 weeks, but you guys seem to have very good order visibility for Q3 and second half. So, it does look like lead times are higher. Can you guys just give us a sense on where the average lead times are today? Just wanted to see how much order and backlog visibility you guys actually have for the second half.
Keith Jackson: Yeah. So, it’s around 14 weeks. But what you see from an order pattern perspective is our industrial and automotive customers and even the cellphone customers, our handset customers will give us a much longer look and actually much longer orders, particularly as they see they’re planning on ramping in the second half. So, a piece of it is lead times and a piece of it is just the nature of the customers we serve.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thanks for the insights there, Keith. And then, on the lower underutilization charges this quarter, just given the better second half order book, manufacturing lead times, are you guys actually starting to [ph] take up wafer starts in your fab now? Or do you have enough [indiscernible] supply and just hope to supply the better demand initially from an improvement in the back-end operations?
Keith Jackson: Yeah. Most of the increase - I mean, all of the increase has really been in the dye supply - for our inventories have been the dye supply here in the first quarter and as we go into the second quarter because we were back-end constrained. So, we really haven’t had to ramp the front-end jet because we’re still playing in a constrained back-end environment. As we get to Q3 with higher revenues, then we can start to look at that.
Harlan Sur: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Pitzer with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John Pitzer: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for letting me ask in the call. Keith, I’m just hoping that you could quantify what you think the supply impact was from COVID in the March quarter and what’s embedded in the June guide. I’m just trying to get a sense that if you weren’t having these issues in Malaysia and the Philippines how much higher do you think revenue could have been in March and how much higher do you think it could be in June.
Keith Jackson: Yeah. I guess, I will try and get as quantified - as viable as I can. We would have made our original guidance in the first quarter had we not had the supply disruptions. And you can figure out that’s a pretty significant number. And actually, in the second quarter, the supply constraints have at least as big of impact, if not slightly more, because it is for a much longer period of time in the second quarter than we had in the first.
John Pitzer: That’s really helpful. Thanks, Keith. And then, I want to go back to your comments about content growth in autos helping kind of take some of the sting out of units being down 20% to 25% this year. I guess, when you look back at calendar year 2019, your business contracted about as much as [ph] SAARS did. And I understand that 2019 within the auto space was also an inventory digestion period. But I got to believe, with units being down this much, that it’s more likely that the supply chain continues to take inventory down in calendar year 2020. So, why are you more optimistic about content growth this year than last? Are there company-specific drivers that you can touch to? Thanks.
Keith Jackson: Twofold. One, we really do think that inventory situation is in better control this year. The orders came down on us quite dramatically in automotive during the first quarter and into the second quarter. So, we believe they’re being very prudent. But they are now getting to levels of inventory that I think that actually concern our customers a bit. They don’t want to go lower than that from a supply perspective. And there are still certainly some memories out there of 2010 from a lot of them. So, I guess, the first order would be we don’t expect more inventory contractions this year. Second piece is, looking at the electric vehicle content and particularly in China, we do think that, that mix will go up much nicer than it was in 2019, very significant increase there. And so, that piece of it, as we mentioned earlier, opens up a couple of hundred dollars or more of content per car. And if you have an increase in EVs in China of a couple of percent, it would certainly offset a weakness of the SAAR that’s been projected.
John Pitzer: Helpful. Thanks, Keith.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra with Baird. Your line is open.
Tristan Gerra: Hi, guys. Good morning. Just a quick follow-up question to John’s question, so what type of point-of-sale is built into your Q2 guidance, given the supply disruptions that you’ve mentioned? And is it - should we assume that inventory level [indiscernible] are going to come down in Q2 and potentially rebound in Q3 as a result of your supply coming back in the second half?
Bernard Gutmann: So, we are assuming an increase in our POS on a sequential basis. We expect that, on a week basis, we’ll be trending back down to the 11 to 13 weeks that we have in our normal operations [ph] growth.
Tristan Gerra: Okay. And then, any quick update on Quantenna in terms of new product development? And any type of potential savings that you’re doing there?
Keith Jackson: We continue to make good progress on our client devices that we talked about at the time of acquisition and, obviously, no revenue here in 2020. We’re not expecting those devices [indiscernible] next year. But the balance of the business has held up quite well. In these environments, folks are still doing the infrastructure investment similar to 2019.
Tristan Gerra: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison with Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Shawn Harrison: Hi. Good morning, everybody. Keith, I was hoping to [indiscernible] point on the automotive content. I think you outperformed production by maybe 17 points in the first quarter. In the past couple of years, you’ve seen, I don’t know, anywhere from 5 points of outperformance to 10 points of outperformance. Do you think second quarter [ph] maybe you more production and then you start to see that type of potentially high-single digit, double-digit outperformance versus production for 2020?
Keith Jackson: Yeah. Again, we’re expecting in the third quarter, as things begin to ramp again, you’ll see more of the leverage. And then, as I mentioned several times, particularly, as the mix shifts more electric, you should see an acceleration of that delta.
Shawn Harrison: Okay. But the second quarter would more maybe mirror global production instead of outperforming?
Keith Jackson: Yes. Well, I’m not looking for any outperformance in the quarter. Again, everybody is shut down and - yes, I would not expect to outperform this quarter.
Shawn Harrison: Great. And then, Bernard, just the incremental $90 million of cost [indiscernible] the first $25 million was more focused then on R&D. I think you were implying that the majority of this $90 million is SG&A related versus incremental R&D. I just wanted a clarification on that, please.
Bernard Gutmann: No, the remaining $90 million is spread across the whole [ph] OpEx P&L geographies, including R&D but also all the other sales and marketing, G&A and a little bit of COGS.
Shawn Harrison: Okay. Maybe relatively equal?
Bernard Gutmann: Probably as a percent, yes.
Shawn Harrison: Okay. Great. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya: Thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to, for the first one, nail down gross margin. So, if - Bernard, let’s say, Q3 sales are flat versus Q2. What’s the gross margin? And if let’s say sales grow 10%, what’s the gross margin assuming some seasonal mix?
Bernard Gutmann: So, definitely, on the - if the revenues are flat, I would still expect the approximately $20 million of period expenses going away. That should be the primary improvement in gross margin and assuming no change in revenue or mix. And if we have a 10%, you pretty much have to take about a 50% fall-through on that incremental 10%.
Vivek Arya: Got it. And then, I was wondering. Did you talk about the [ph] - the resale activity in June? What are your expectations? And just kind of what we should think of your balance sheet inventory and distribution inventory exiting June? Thank you.
Bernard Gutmann: So, let me start with internal inventories. We expect those to be flattish to slightly higher. To Keith’s comment about depending on how strong we see the third quarter, we might have to restart some of the fabs at a higher level [indiscernible] more dye. On the [ph] days of the inventory, as I mentioned earlier, we expect to trend back down to that 11 to 13 weeks due to stronger resale sequentially than in the first quarter.
Vivek Arya: Okay. Thanks very much.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Craig Hettenbach: Yes. Thank you. Just a question on automotive and understanding the quarterly trends could be noisy, but in the full year in the context of if auto production is down 20% to 25%, what would you expect to be kind of a rough growth for ON in 2020?
Bernard Gutmann: So, we expect that the unit - the content growth will be just like we have talked for a long time in that 7% to 8%. So, we can see that whatever the unit [ph] is they’re offset by a 7% to 8% content growth [ph] offset.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. Thanks. And then, just to follow up on the 300-millimeter, really, in the context of consolidating other fabs, can you just talk about maybe a rough time line of how that plays out over the next couple of years?
Keith Jackson: So, we’ve announced the divestiture of one of our factories now, closure of a second one there in Rochester, New York [ph] have both been announced those will be actioned sometime in the next year. And that we have no further ones to announce today. But clearly, the demand picture in 2021 will give us some more direction on timing.
Craig Hettenbach: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of [ph] Nick Perdovas with Long Beach Research . Your line is open.
Unidentified Analyst: Thanks. Good morning, guys. I just want to go back to the industrial comments and specifically the strength in China. I was wondering if you can give us some more color. I think you mentioned indications of increased automation and robotics. Do you see the current pandemic kind of essentially putting the [ph] seeds due to a secular change in that industry and to your point seeing that increase in automation, if you can comment? To what level of the demand in China and industrial is coming back to compared to pre-COVID levels?
Keith Jackson: Yeah. So, first, I’ll talk about trends. We do see this pandemic as accelerating people’s thoughts and investment in automation. And so, we are seeing that industrial automation piece pick up quite nicely. And we think that, that will be a continued trend because, again, just from a rational business perspective, the biggest impact we’ve had is on the people sort of the more automation we have, the less expectation for further disruption. But broadly beyond just that secular trend, we do see a pick back up. And the factories closed in the first quarter in China. The orders completely stopped. And what we’re seeing now is just a return to a more normal environment that we had pre-Chinese New Year, so not excessively greater than we had pre-Chinese New Year, but very similar to that.
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."
4109,TSLA,2,2020,2020-07-22 22:28:05,"Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to Tesla’s Q2 2020 Financial Results Q&A and Webcast. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speaker presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker, Mr. Martin Viecha, Senior Director for Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.
Martin Viecha: Thank you, Sherry, and good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla’s second quarter 2020 Q&A webcast. I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn and a number of other Executives. Our Q2 results were announced at about 1:15 PM Pacific Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During the call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. [Operator Instructions] But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?
Elon Musk: Thank you. First of all, I'd like to thank the Tesla team for exceptional execution in the second quarter despite tremendous difficulties. They've done an incredible job, and it's an honor to work with such a great team. I mean, there were so many challenges, too numerous to name, but they got it done, and just what a great group to work with, like I said, it's just an honor to work with such a great team. And as a result, we were able to achieve our fourth consecutive profitable quarter, and although the automotive industry was down about 30% year-over-year in the first half of the year, we managed to grow deliveries in the first half of the year. So despite that massive industry decline, we actually went up. We're also very excited to announce that we're going to be building our next Gigafactory in Texas. It's going to be right near Austin. It will be about -- I'll just go into a bit of detail on this, and then I'm sure there'll be a lot of questions. But the location is five minutes from Austin International Airport and 15 minutes from Downtown Austin, and it's about 2,000 acres, and we're going to make it a factory that is going to be stunning. It's right on the Colorado River. So we're actually going to have a boardwalk where there'll a hiking and biking trail. It's going to basically be an ecological paradise. Birds in the trees, butterfly, fish in the stream, and they will be open to the public as well. So not closed and only Tesla. So if anyone is interested in looking at Giga Texas, with engineering, production, whatever the case may be, please let us know. This is -- we're going to be doing a major factory there. And it's also where we'll be doing Cybertruck there, the Tesla Semi. And we'll be doing Model 3 and Y for the eastern half of North America. Now at the same time, I want to say, we will continue to grow in California. But we expect California to do Model S and X for worldwide consumption and 3 and Y for the western half of North America. And then we think probably also the Tesla Roadster, a future program, would also make sense in California. So I think this is a nice split between Texas and California. And just to emphasize, we'll continue to grow in California, but we'll be creating a massive factory and Cybertruck and Semi programs in Texas. And I also want to just do a shout out to Tulsa, and just say thank you very much to the Tulsa team, the economic development team and the governor, really, I was super impressed. The whole Tesla team is super impressed, and we will, for sure, strongly consider Tulsa for future expansion of Tesla down the road. Let's see, is there anything more I want to say about? There's a lot of information. So anything, guys? All right. Well, I'm sure they have lots of questions. We've already started work on the facility, so some initial construction work. So it's already underway, started this weekend. Let's see, moving on to other subjects, Solar. We recently adjusted the pricing of our retrofit solar. So Tesla Solar is the lowest cost solar in the United States. And we added the lowest cost guarantee and a money-back guarantee. So we're very confident that people will have our solar product, whether it's the Solar Retrofit or Solar Roof. Our Solar is now 30% cheaper than the U.S. average. After the Federal Tax Credit, Tesla Solar now costs $1.49 per watt. And it's very simple, highly automated single-click experience. So definitely, think about Tesla, whether you want a new roof or Tesla Solar Roof or you want Solar on your existing roof either way, we're the company to go to. And then you also get a Powerwall and have energy independence and be your own utility. So I think that product is really coming together and it's only going to get better later this year. So just very excited about that business potential. On the additional technology stuff, we introduced the first production car with more than 400 miles range. So the current Tesla Model S now has an EPA-certified range of 402 miles. I mean, you basically can drive from L.A. to San Francisco nonstop and still have some miles left over when you arrive. And this is at highway speed. So you don't have to anything drive slowly or anything drive -- you can just drive normally and go very long distances. And then for full self-driving, we launched traffic lights and stop signs and we continue to improve that to make them more robust. And we're currently testing full self-driving software for intersections and city streets and narrow streets. So I personally tested the latest Alpha build of the full self-driving software when I drive my car. And it is really, I think, profoundly better than people realize. Yes, really profound. It's like amazing. So it's almost getting to a point where I can go from my house to work with no interventions, despite going through construction and widely varying situations. So this is why I'm very confident about full self-driving functionality being complete by the end of this year. It's because I'm literally driving it. In conclusion, I'd like to again say thanks for all the hard-work of the Tesla team, achieving our first full year of profitability in the company history. It was incredibly difficult. And just as a result of the hard-work of a lot of people from Tesla worldwide. And yes, just think about the next 12 to 18 months, we'll have 3 new factories in place. Things are looking great with Giga Berlin, and we'll have Cybertruck, Semi, Roadster, Full Self-Driving. There's so much to be excited about. It's really hard to kind of fit into this call. But the sheer amount of hardcore engineering, especially on the autonomy and the manufacturing engineering front is mind blowing. And then, of course, there's Factory Day, which is coming up pretty soon. And I think that's really going to surprise people by just how much there is to see. So with that, thanks, again, for your support on our long-term mission. And we're looking forward to having a great journey with you, to create amazing products and continue scaling it. And, yes, this is -- I think, I've never been more optimistic or excited about the future of Tesla and the history of the company. Thank you.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. And I think our CFO, Zachary Kirkhorn, has some remarks as well.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. Thanks, Martin. I want to start by thanking our employees, customers and suppliers for your support over the last quarter. In particular to the Tesla team, I couldn't be more impressed with the hard work and the resiliency that you all have shown. On net income, overall, as Elon mentioned, we achieved our fourth sequential quarter of profitability. This is despite a significant impact to our financials as a result of suspended operations of our U.S. factories and field operations around the world. To ensure the business remains healthy, we took temporary action to reduce costs, including expenses related to personnel and non-critical patent projects. The direct cost savings -- or the direct cost impact of the temporary shutdown was largely offset by these cost savings actions. Although, the cost were concentrated in COGS and the cost reductions were in both COGS and operating expenses. On automotive gross margin excluding regulatory credits is this reduced sequentially from 20% to 18.7%. This sequential reduction is fully attributed to idle capacity charges and lower operational efficiency, due to the various shutdowns. Despite these charges, we continue to make progress, reducing our costs, particularly on Model Y in Fremont, and Model 3 in Shanghai. Given the global macroeconomic context, we made the decision in Q2 to pass-through savings to customers around the world on some of our products. With the release of stoplight and stop sign recognition and response, we recognized $48 million of deferred revenue in the period. The full profit impact on our P&L is less than half of this, due to costs associated with FSD computer retrofits in the field. Regulatory credit revenue increased sequentially to $428 million. While difficult to forecast precisely, our best estimate of 2020 credit revenue is roughly double that of 2019. Services and other margin improved yet again, marking the fifth sequential quarter of improvement. In the Energy business, our Megapack product achieved its first quarterly profit. We remain production-constrained in this business and are continuing to work towards building additional capacity. And our solar installation business was impacted by permit office closures, limiting installation volume. Stock-based comp increased from Q1 to Q2. This is driven almost entirely by an expense related to the next tranche of the CEO grant, as well as early vesting of the first tranche, which is reflected in SG&A within operating expenses. On cash flows, our cash balance increased to our highest level yet of $8.6 billion, which included free cash flows of over $400 million. This is a strong result on its own, despite an increase in capital expenses associated with Shanghai and Berlin, as well as movements in working capital. A few things to note on working capital, particularly accounts receivables. While our AR balance is usually about 20% of revenue, it can fluctuate depending upon a number of factors. First, overall, less than 30% of our receivables is associated with new car sales. Second, due to payment terms associated with financing and enterprise customers, settlement time lines for certain methods of cash payments and geographic mix of our deliveries, our cash balance and associated receivables are impacted significantly by how many cars are delivered in the final weeks and days of the quarter. Third, roughly 40% of the balance is attributed to payment terms on regulatory credit sales and statutory EV incentive programs, both of which have been increasing. Customer deposits reduced slightly as well. Note that as we transition to lower order fees across the world, the average deposit per order will continue to reduce driving down this balance. As we look forward, Tesla was able to navigate through Q2 due to our agile and dynamic culture. We will continue to appropriately manage our cash flows through cost optimization and close working capital management. This is key as we remain focused on expanding production, scaling our operations and preparing for the launch of three new factories over the next 1.5 years.
A - Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. Let's go to questions from institutional investors first. The question number one is, as Tesla continues its journey towards the long-term goal of selling 20 million units per year, what are the most important vehicle programs that will drive volume growth over the next three to five years beyond Model 3, Y and the Cybertruck? Cheaper, smaller versions of 3 and Y? Or region-specific vehicles? Or anything else?
Elon Musk: I don't think we can comment on our detailed product roadmap beyond what's announced because I think we want to reserve that for product launches. But it would be reasonable to assume that we would make a compact vehicle of some kind and probably a higher capacity [indiscernible] vehicle of some kind. These are likely things at some point. But I do think there's a long way to go with 3 and Y and with Cybertruck and Semi. So it's a long way to go with those. I think we'll do the obvious things.
Martin Viecha: Okay. The second question from institutional is, what is your vision for software at Tesla? What opportunities do you see from monetizing the installed base other than by FSD?
Elon Musk: Right now, by far, FSD is just overwhelmingly the most important thing. I think the upgrading of the fleet to full-self driving, especially with an over-the-air software update. I mean, we go down as the biggest asset value increase in history as a step change. Maybe there's something bigger, but it certainly would be one of the biggest -- I can't think of anything bigger. So overnight, 1 million -- depending on exactly on when it happens and when it's allowed in various regulatory jurisdictions, you have like at least a few million cars, suddenly becoming five times more valuable or something like that. Certainly five times higher utility. They go from like 12 hours a week of utility, something like that or [indiscernible] to 60, something like that. So, everything else is pretty small by comparison. Now, when things do become full self-driving, so what are we going to do in the car? Well, I guess we're probably going want to do productivity and entertainment of some kind. Or maybe play games and do work. That's in the future. We're already putting some games and stuff on the car, just for fun.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes, we have been experimenting on that. So, FSD remains, by far and away, the biggest opportunity in the near-term. But we're putting the plumbing in place to be ready to scale other areas when the time is right. So, premium connectivity subscription is something that we've put in place. And the ability to upgrade your vehicle through the app, for example, on Acceleration Boost or upgrading a Standard Range Model 3 to a Standard Plus, adding rear-heated seats. So, these are things that we have and we're continuing to get feedback from the field and other things that we can launch and we'll trickle those in with time.
Elon Musk: Yes. But they're all very tiny compared with like the step change to full self-driving depending upon how you calculate it is probably worth at least $100,000 per car. So, it's a lot of software you have to sell in the App Store or whatever, yes.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The third question is also about Autopilot. What are the most important upcoming self-driving milestones? And how do you think about timing?
Elon Musk: Well, the actual major milestone that's happening right now is really a transition of the autonomy system of the cars like AI, if you will, from thinking about things in -- like two and a half feet. It's like think -- things like isolated pictures and doing image recognition on pictures that are [partially] [ph] correlated in time, but not very well and transitioning to kind of a 4D where it's like -- which is video essentially. You're thinking about the world in three dimensions and the fourth dimension being time. So, that architectural change, which has been underway for some time but has not really been rolled out to anyone in the production fleet, is what really matters for full self-driving. So, what we've been doing, thus far, is really just things like 2D -- mostly 2D and like I said, not well correlated in time. So, just hard to convey just how much better a fully 4D system would work -- does work. It's capable of things that if you just look -- looking at things as individual pictures as opposed to video -- basically, like you could go from like individual pictures to surround video. So, it's fundamental. So, the car will seem to have just like a giant improvement. [Indiscernible] probably rolling out later this year. We'll be able to do traffic lights, stop, turns, [trust] [ph], everything, pretty much. And then it will be a long march of nines, essentially. How many nines of reliability are okay. So it's definitely way better than human, but how much better than human does need to be. So that's actually going to be the real work. There's just a massive amount of work with each, kind of, order of magnitude of reliability. But you'll see it happen. And if you plot the points on the curve, it would be kind of [up-ish[ ph]] where it's headed. AI, in general, I think, is something -- I've been saying this, banging this AI drum for a decade, we should be concerned about where AI is going. The people I see being the most [wrong] [ph] about AI are the ones who are very smart, because they can't imagine that a computer could be way smarter than them. That's the flaw in their logic. They're just way dumber than they think they are.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. And the next question from institutional investors is. Please, may you update us on Alien Dreadnought? How has your thinking evolved and what is needed in order to get closer to fundamental physical limits?
Elon Musk: Well, we bring a massive amount of effort into manufacturing engineering, the machine that makes the machine. There's probably 1,000%, maybe 10,000% more engineering required for the factory then for the product itself. So we're certainly making progress. I mean, battery and powertrain factory, Gigafactory in Nevada is, you know, alien dreadnought version 0.5, something like that, starting to approach version 1. We're getting way better at making cars. You can see that in Giga Shanghai. You'll see that even more with Berlin. And we're really changing the design of the car in order to make it more manufacturable. The fundamental architecture of Model Y will be different in Berlin, it may look the same, but the internals will be quite different and fundamentally more efficient architecturally than what we've done to date. Drew, would you like to add to that?
Drew Baglino: Yes. I was going to expand on that. I think part of the Alien Dreadnought concept is not just automation, but minimizing the number of process steps and complexity involved in the manufacturing system, which involves really integrating design and manufacturing across from like when the raw materials enter the factory to the finished goods exit. And we're learning so much through doing that.
Elon Musk: Vertical integration is extremely important to this. But the supply chain, if you put like a GPS tracker on a molecule from when it got mined to when it was in a usable product, it would look insane. It would be like, wow, it went around the world like six times. So with vertical integration, maybe you can only go around the world once. It would be a huge improvement, or not even like half -- I think, I get vertical integration in litigation an order of magnitude improvement. So yes. And its -- do you want to Drew...
Drew Baglino: Yes. I think the focus for us is increasing CapEx efficiency. This is something that we've been working very hard for the past 3 years. And you can see that we can build new factories for less amount of money and much faster. Those things go together.
Elon Musk: It's a better factory for less money in less time.
Drew Baglino: Yes. Less money means less time. So that's a great advantage. And also reducing this -- and there still is a lot, the amount of inefficiencies. We want every operation to add value to the vehicle; value, meaning moving the atoms closer to the final state. So we do not want any robot that just moves things.
Elon Musk: Or in fact, it's like we want to be super respectful of people's labor. If we're asking somebody to do something, are we sure it's useful? Are we asking them to spend their timing a way that is respectful of their time? But it's like, wow, the like, the potential for improvement is tremendous. But it's I just want to be clear. At Tesla, we love manufacturing. It's awesome. And I really think more smart people should be working on manufacturing.
Drew Baglino: We want more people. We don’t find enough people. People are interested in designing new lines and trying to do things different, Tesla's got a job for you. And now we've got jobs everywhere. It's not only in California. Now we've got just in China, in Berlin, in Austin, Texas and in California. So there's plenty of exciting places. And all these places will do original work and challenging meaningful work.
Elon Musk: Yes. Absolutely. It's actually extremely exciting and fulfilling to design new production systems. And I think that for some reason, I kind of got a bad rep, especially in the U.S. for a long time. And I think people didn't think that manufactured -- they sort of put manufacturing is like, oh, this is for some boring, just making copies, whatever. But actually, there's far more opportunity for innovation in manufacturing than in the products itself, order magnitude. So like if there's one thing that comes out of this call, it's like, hey, if you want to help us invent amazing, new manufacturing techniques and have input into the product itself, it's not like you just get touch the product and say, hey, make this product and it's kind of a lousy design. If you're manufacturing, you get to change the product design, and say, hey, this product, you're asking your manufacturers dumb. Like, great, let's fix it. So it has, if you work on manufacturing engineering, but you don't just get force fed a sandwich. You get to change the product design. So it's super exciting. And we evolve the lines even after they're both this rapid evolution of the production system. So…
Drew Baglino: And there's nothing more rewarding than going from 0 cars an hour to 5,000 cars a week or 1,000 cars a day.
Elon Musk: Yes. So the long-term sustainable advantage of Tesla, I think, will be manufacturing.
Martin Viecha: And the last question from institutional investor is, how many vehicles can Tesla produce in Texas?
Elon Musk: Well, right now, 0. But long term, a lot.
Drew Baglino: It's our biggest property.
Elon Musk: Yes, it's biggest property, true.
Martin Viecha: Okay. And now we can shift to retail investor questions on Say.com. The first one is, Tesla Energy seems widely ignored by Wall Street, despite Elon comments about growth rate exceeding automotive. Could Tesla share more detail on calendar planned projects to help investors better understand the business outlook? How disruptive is Tesla's Autobidder technology?
Elon Musk: Yes. I can't emphasize. I think long term, Tesla Energy will be roughly the same size as Tesla Automotive. So, I mean, the Energy business collectively is bigger than the automotive business. So you feel like, how big is the Energy sector? Bigger than automotive. And in order to achieve a sustainable energy future, we have to have sustainable energy generation, which I think is going to be primarily solar and followed by wind. And those are intermittent. So you need to have a lot of batteries to store the solar energy, because the wind doesn't always blow and the sun doesn't always shine. So there's like three elements of the sustainable energy future: wind and solar sustainable energy generation; battery storage; and electric transport, those three things. And the mission of Tesla is to accelerate sustainable energy. So I can't emphasize enough. Yes. The battery and solar will both be enormous. And they kind of have to be in order to -- for us to have a sustainable future. And we've got a great product road map on that front as well. So we're going to ship in the Megapack. It's very well received. Drew, you want to talk about that?
Drew Baglino: Yes. I think the Megapack has represented itself and is an integrated rapidly deployable grid tied storage battery of megawatt hour scale. We're working with utilities, large and small, not just utilities, but also just like microgrid and project developers of all type, and building our own projects where it makes sense. And there's a lot of demand for the product, and we're growing the production rates as fast as we can for that product. And then on Autobidder, Autobidder is basically autopilot for grid-type batteries. It's an autonomous energy market participation system that does high-frequency trading in short...
Elon Musk: That's a bad word.
Drew Baglino: Sorry.
Elon Musk: How should free instant energy called front running. We're not doing that.
Drew Baglino: Not doing anything like that. No, it's ensuring that the battery is doing everything it can to manage the grid intermittency of the renewals -- renewables and just grid intermittency of all kinds. I mean, people turn their lights on and off, power plants turn on and off, factories ramp up and down and batteries are great to solve those problems.
Elon Musk: Yes. Its just grid stabilization at the most heightened level. So it just shows that things are super smooth. It's like a UPS, uninterruptible power supply of a normal size. But just ensure that this grid has smooth sailing. And then the batteries, the computers like all interact with each other and make sure that they're working together to make the grid smooth. And this can be done with the Powerwalls and the Megapacks and the Powerpacks all working together and interacting with third-party systems as well.
Drew Baglino: Yes. Essentially, are distributed. It does both.
Elon Musk: Yes. 
Drew Baglino: Yes. I mean, we've…
Elon Musk: It’s just necessary in order to solve the sustainable energy problem.
Drew Baglino: Yes, you can't plan power plants on the hourly scale in a renewable world. You need to optimize them on a minute-by-minute scale, and that's what we're doing.
Elon Musk: Yes. The real limitation on Tesla growth is cell production at affordable price. That's the real limit. So that's why we're going to talk about a lot more about this on Battery Day because this is a fundamental scaling constraint. And any part of that supply chain or pricing at the cell level will be the limiting factor. So whatever maybe an error from mining to refining, those many steps that are refining to cathode and analog formation, cell formation, whatever the truck point is, that will set the growth rate. And so we expect to expand our business with Panasonic, with CATL, with LG, possibly with others. And there's a lot more to say on that front on Battery Day.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. And the second question is, now that it's time to bring the Tesla Semi to volume production, can you share more detail on production plans? What weekly production rate is considered volume production? And when does Tesla expect to reach that rate?
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. So we'll start production next year, as we announced it before. I'm personally very excited about the project. I can't wait. We do have a few trucks that keep driving around and like keep delivering cars. But we're going to accelerate that. I want to be clear that the first few units, we will use ourselves, Tesla to carry our own freight, probably mostly between Fremont and Reno, which is a fantastic test route. We're going to prove that we have very good reliability. And so far, the early units do have it, but we'll do that at a larger scale. And we have also promised some early units to some long term, very patient and supportive customers, and we'll do that. Now we have more sales coming up in next year, as Elon just pointed out. So we can increase the diversity of the portfolio. It didn't make sense up to now to do it. But we'll be ready. And that's maybe a little biased. I'm very excited about this. And we have a lot of very unique technology that we're always dreaming about that we will be putting into that Semi. It will be just awesome. Yes.
Elon Musk: Yes. And there’s like two general classes of cell. There's like iron phosphate, and then the nickel based, the nickel based cells have higher energy density so longer range. Obviously, those are needed for something like Semi, where every, every unit of mass that you add in battery pack you have to subtract in cargo. So it's very important to have a mass efficient and long range pack for four batteries. What we're seeing with our passenger vehicles is that our powertrain efficiency and tire efficiency, drive coefficient like basically all of the things that, like, you know, our HVAC, going to a heat pump, basically our total vehicle efficiency has gotten good enough with Model 3, for example, that we actually are comfortable having an iron phosphate battery pack in Model 3 in China and that that'll be in volume production later this year. So, we think that getting a range that is in the high 200 -- basically, we think you probably getting a range of almost 300 miles with an iron phosphate pack, taking into account a whole bunch of powertrain and other vehicle efficiencies. And that frees up a lot of capacity for things like the Tesla Semi and the other projects so far higher energy density. So, yes, so you have like two supply chains that you can tap into iron phosphate or nickel. We use very little cobalt in our system already and that's -- that may to zero along, so it's basically about nickel.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, Tesla recently decided not to produce Standard 3 Range version of Model Y. No longer offers a Standard Range Model S or X and has announced ramping of the Semi. Does this shift from smaller pack vehicles suggest that Tesla is not battery constrained as in the past? What are the biggest constraints now?
Elon Musk: Well, I'd just like to reemphasize, any mining companies out there, please mine more nickel. Okay. Wherever you are in the world, please mine more nickel and don't wait for nickel to go back to some long -- some high point that you experienced some five years ago or whatever, go for efficiency. As environmentally friendly, nickel mining at high volume. Tesla will give you a giant contract for a long period of time if you mine nickel efficiently and in an environmentally-sensitive way. So, hopefully, this message goes out to all mining companies. Please get nickel. With regard to passenger vehicles, I think the new normal for Range is going to be just in U.S. EPA terms approximately 300 miles. So, I think people will really come to expect that as some number close to 300 miles as normal. That's a standard expectation because you do need to take into account, like, is it very hot outside or very cold? Or are you driving up into a mountain with a full load? And it's -- people don't want to have -- get to the destination with like 10 miles range, they want some reasonable margins. So, I think 300 is going to be really -- or close to 300 is going to be a new normal. Call it 500 kilometers basically -- roughly.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Next question on insurance. What is the hold up for Tesla Insurance outside of California? Will you release numbers from that part of the business? Will Tesla Insurance be required to participate in the Tesla ride hailing network as a driver?
Elon Musk: Sure.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. We were joking before the call that we get the quarterly insurance question that -- funsay.com [ph] here. We are working super hard on insurance. I'll go into a little bit more deal here than I have in the past. Currently, we have a product in California, as I've described before, it's been quite well received and I would largely describe it as a fairly standard insurance product with elements of it that are unique to our cars. So you can think of it as a version one of Tesla Insurance…
Elon Musk: Version 0.9 is it getting at least.
Zachary Kirkhorn: 0.9. What we're working on now is -- we can call it version two, or we can call it the first version of our Telematics product. And so really ultimately where we want to get to with Tesla Insurance is to be able to use the data that's captured in the car, in the driving profile of the person in the car, to be able to assess correlations and probabilities of crash and be able then to assess a premium on a monthly basis for that customer. And what makes this very exciting for us is the amount of data that is available, with the customer's permission to use, is not available on any other product or any other vehicle in the world. So this gives us a unique advantage in terms of information. And we have a decision point here where we could take the California product and replicate that into other states, or we could delay going into additional states and instead put more effort into the Telematics side of this. And we chose the latter. And where we are now is nearly complete with the risk and cost analysis associated with the first version of the Telematics product. We hope to be filing that in a handful of states with regulators very shortly. And assuming that regulatory approvals go smoothly, we hope to have this in a handful of states by the end of the year. And then we'll continue to file for approval in additional states. With regulatory approval there, we'll continue to roll this out nationwide as quickly as we can. And then that product, as we continue to collect more data and reiterate on it, there'll be version two, version three, et cetera, as we continue to refine that.
Elon Musk: Yes. I mean, at the heart of being competitive with insurance is what is the accuracy of your information. Like are you dealing with -- are you forced to assess people statistically looking in the rear-view mirror Or can you assess people individually, looking ahead with smart projections, and inform the driver that -- how they may reduce their -- what actions they can take to reduce their insurance, as Zach was alluding to, it's like, okay, you're driving too fast, you're on this that, the other thing, it's like if you want to pay more for insurance, you can. But if you want to pay less, then please don't drive so crazy. Then people can make a choice. Like, okay, they want to drive aggressively, in the case, it'll be higher insurance, or they want more capital enter driving and pay less. This was actually very helpful for us to have a feedback loop to see what is driving insurance expense. A lot of it is just -- it's like a little fender bender and the net fender bender because of the way that the body collision repair is being done, it cost like $15,000 or something crazy, and like, and then we can actually adjust the design of the car and adjust how the repair is done to actually have the fundamental cost of solving that problem would be less. So this has helped us under a whole bunch of facility things that we were doing basically without realizing it. But this is a problem with, in general, with insurance is like if the insurance is like, all you can eat, then the feedback loop for improvement is sweet. So this gives us a great feedback for improvement, because it's basically a fundamentally better insurance product. I'd also like to say, I'm inspired of recruiting because if there's one thing I'd like to come out of this call, it's that a lot of great people want to join Tesla. That's the other one thing I'd like to take on this call. And on the insurance front, I want to be clear. We're building a great, like a major insurance company. If you're interested in revolutionary insurance, please join Tesla. I would love to have some high energy actuaries, especially. I have great respect for the actuarial profession. Your guys are great at math, please join Tesla. Especially if you want to change things and you're annoyed by how slow the industry is. This is the place to be. We want revolutionary actuaries.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Sorry. So there was the second part of this question, will Tesla Insurance be required to participate in the Tesla ride-hailing network? And so, I think I've answered this before in prior calls, but by the time the ride-hailing network is available, we will -- Tesla Insurance coverage will be provided to folks who are in this network. It's a different type of insurance because of the use of the car. It's not decided whether third-party insurance versus Tesla Insurance will be required. There might be some things we need to think through there. But Tesla Insurance, at least, will be working, working for the ride-hailing network.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. And in the interest of time lets go to the Q&A of analyst from the line.
Operator: Thank you. Our first question will come from Dan Levy with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.
Dan Levy: Hi good afternoon. Thank you. I'll ask a question on quarter and then just a question more broadly on strategy. Just on the quarter, if you could give us an update on gross margin. Was China accretive to gross margin in the second quarter? And give us an idea of how far Model Y gross margin was versus Fremont Model 3? And then just more broadly on strategy, it seems like your approach to in-sourcing is varying by region. You're in-sourcing a lot more in Fremont, but you're relying a lot more on the supply chain in Shanghai. What do you expect your approach to be on in-sourcing when you eventually open up Berlin? And what your Texas factory is going to be? Thank you.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. Just to start with the gross margin questions. We did see progress on gross margins in China, and that was despite pricing action that was taken. The factory is still not running at full capacity yet as it continues to ramp. So we think there's think there's a continued opportunity to optimize the cost structure there. Model Y, as we mentioned last quarter, was profitable in its first quarter of production. And despite the inefficiencies that we had due to the shutdown, we did see pretty substantial improvement in the Model Y margin. And as we said before, the Model Y cost structure and Model 3 cost structure will converge. They're not quite there, Model Y is still slightly more expensive than Model 3, and it's not yet at full production. And with Model Y carrying a slightly higher price point, you can kind of back into the math there on the relative gross margins.
Elon Musk: Yes. I mean the Shanghai factory is a pretty big factory. And it's continuing to do more and more internally. But it's also -- the thing that's really helping is like there were previously a ton of parts that were made in other parts of the world that were being shipped to Shanghai from every part of the world. And just locally sourcing those components makes a massive difference to the cost of the vehicle. And I mean, the proportion of local sourcing has literally been rising at like 5% to 10% a month, from 40 -- it was like 40% at the beginning this year, something like that, it will be like 80% by the end of this year, maybe more.
Zach Kirkhorn: There is also a lot -- very strong, very competent and very eager suppliers around the factory in China.
Elon Musk: Yes. I will say it like this. The suppliers in China have been extremely competitive, possibly the most competitive in the world.
Zach Kirkhorn: And so far, we're in negotiations with -- for Berlin and we've awarded a lot of business. Also a lot of suppliers in Germany or the rest of Europe that are eager to support the factory in Berlin. Yes.
Elon Musk: Yes. Well, obviously, Germany has a great automotive industry and supply chain. So, actually, a ton of our suppliers are in Germany within like a few hundred kilometers of the factory.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. Let’s go to the next question please.
Operator: Our next question will come from Toni Sacconaghi with Bernstein. Please go ahead.
Toni Sacconaghi: Yes. Thank you. You mentioned in the slide deck a couple of times that you were pleased with gross margin with PTI margin progress and you expect it to achieve industry-leading operating margins over time. Maybe you could shed a little light on that? Industry-leading for luxury vendors is 8% to 10% PTI. For Porsche, it's smaller, at 17%. For mass market vendors, it's 5% to 8%. What do we think about? And how much, ultimately, do you believe that EV credits will contribute to that margin? Because I know your margin has been 5% over the last 12 months, but it's actually less than 1%, excluding EV credit, so it’s a 4 point contribution right now. How do we think about ultimately what industry-leading margins are? And how much of that you think is coming from EV credits, regulatory credits? And I have a follow-up, please.
Zach Kirkhorn: Sure. I've mentioned this before in terms of regulatory credit. We manage the business, said differently, we don't manage the business with the assumption that regulatory credits will contribute in a significant way to the future. I do expect regulatory credit revenue to double in 2020 relative to 2019, and it will continue for some period of time, but eventually, the stream of regulatory credits will reduce.
Elon Musk: Yes. I mean, it's worth telling that we're -- buyers of our car in the U.S. received 0 federal tax credit. Whereas many of our competitors are like, they get a $7,500 pack tax credit. And yet our sales have continued to do well. Yes.
Zach Kirkhorn: Yes. And so what we see is a continued decline in the cost to produce manufacturing and distribute our cars. That cost curve, even for mature products, like the S and the X, continues to come down as we work on that. Model 3, which is our second most mature product, that continues to come down. You then layer on top of that, as Elon was discussing earlier, the potential for software-based revenue, particularly full self-driving, there's the revenue recognition portion of that, that we have today, that, that will expand as we release more features. And then you can layer on top of that, in the future, revenue from a ride-hail network. Operating expenses continue to come down and become more efficient as a percentage of revenue. There's still incredible opportunity there that we were working on, particularly on how customers interact with the company from sales and service and what their flow is and how we get cars to them. So we continue to see efficiencies there. So in the medium term here, what our modeling shows is in the low teens operating margin level. And I think there continues to drive the opportunity to drive that up. So I hear your point on the 5% and the 1%. We're on a bit of a journey here, and we're continuing to be partner [ph].
Toni Sacconaghi: Thank you. And if I could just follow-up, Elon, you've talked a lot about the mission of the company in -- and really trying to drive EV adoption globally. So how do you think about that trade-off between driving towards industry-leading profitability, yet trying to make your cars more affordable and broader? It feels like, historically, you've always picked the path of, I'd rather drive more growth and more adoption because ultimately, that's the mission of the company, and we even saw it a little bit this quarter with price reductions, you could have probably kept price where it is, sold some units and had better profits, but that's been an ongoing choice that Tesla, as a company has made. So how do you personally think about that trade-off between, even if you were to get to industry-leading margins, wouldn't you be inclined to give more of that back to drive a greater adoption more quickly?
Elon Musk: Well, I think we actually achieved both when you factor in autonomy. I think we can go way beyond industry margins and have the car be affordable to more and more people and potentially almost everyone when you're factoring in autonomy. But that was really a mega game changer, giga game changer. Yes. But I mean, it is important for people to distinguish between two things. There's value for money that our product has; and then there's affordability. And even if you rail value for money and have value for money, like infinite, if people don't have enough -- if people do not have enough money in their bank account to buy the car, they simply cannot. So then you used to have this cycle or something that nobody can buy. So it is important to make the car affordable, and we will not succeed in our mission if we do not make cars affordable. Like the thing that bugs me the most about where we are right now is that our cars are not affordable enough. We need to fix that. So we're all making progress in that regard, just sort of steadily gaining progress. So yes, we need to not go bankrupt. Obviously, that's important because that will fail in our mission. But we're not trying to be super profitable either, obviously, profitability is like 1% or something, this 1% or 2%. It's not crazy. Last quarter, it was only like 0.1%. So we want to be profitable. Like I think just we want to be like slightly profitable and maximize growth and make the cars as affordable as possible, and that's what we're trying to achieve.
Martin Viecha : Thank you. Let’s go to the next question, please.
Operator: Our next question will come from Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.
Emmanuel Rosner: Hi, good afternoon. Could you please characterize the current near-term demand environment for your vehicles? These are obviously unusual times. I think back in Q1, you had indicated record backlog, I guess, at the beginning of this past quarter. I haven't seen any specific comments about new orders or backlog in the release today. So, can you give us some color?
Elon Musk: Demand is not a problem. Definitely not. We do have some production supply chain challenges we're trying to slow right now. For example, the Model Y, we're body casting, obviously, because it's new technology, it's been tricky to maintain rates and keep growing the rate for Model Y casting, which is -- it's a two-piece casting with a bunch -- and there's about half dozen other parts that are added on, that will transition to a one-piece casting. In fact, I'm super excited about this. We're going to have a -- the world's biggest casting press is getting assembled right now actually in Fremont for the Model Y rear body casting. It's enormous and looks awesome. So, it's -- look, the things that are troubling us right now are not demand, that they are just a bunch of firefighting on supply chain and production issues.
Emmanuel Rosner: Okay. So -- 
Elon Musk: Sorry. Yes. Don't worry about demand. That's not the issue.
Emmanuel Rosner: Okay. So, when you're saying achieving 500,000 deliveries has become more difficult, was it really just a function of the recent shutdowns and some of these supply dynamics?
Elon Musk: Yes. It's not true at demand. It's really just a production issue. It's been pretty hard when you've got like a global supply chain, and it's kind of whatever the most effective part of supply chain is that sets your rate. I mean the number of rabbits do know how to pull out of a hat for supply chain is insane, team has done an amazing job. So, I think also some of our costs were related to having to use a lot of airplanes to get parts around because of part shortages. So, we'll hopefully use fewer airplanes. That will improve our costs, but demand exceeds supply right now. That's where we are now.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. And the last question please.
Operator: Our last question today will come from Philippe Houchois with Jefferies. Please go ahead.
Philippe Houchois: Yes. Good afternoon. Thank you. You mentioned a few times the constraint to growth is battery capacity still. And I was hoping you could clarify the scope of the Berlin plans for building right now. Will there be the battery capacity consistence with the amount of assembly volume you expect to come out of the -- ? And if not, would you be able to source, your battery requirements, out of Europe? Or would you have to import batteries from outside Europe to ensure production in Berlin?
Elon Musk: Okay. We can't say too much about this. Except that, where there will be local cell production and -- that will serve the needs of the Berlin factory. Drew, is there anything? Berlin factory. Drew, is there anything -- yes?
Drew Baglino: I mean, no, that's straightforward enough. I think just adding to what you said earlier about talent and people, like the same goes in all areas of cell, supply chain, manufacturing materials, design, we are solving this problem. And we -- we're treating it like any other problem that we have solved. We will solve this problem, talented people to join us as we solve this problem.
Elon Musk: Yes. And like, so my biggest concern for getting our talented people is just probably Berlin, because the labor mobility in Europe is not as low. I would recommend changing this. Like somebody wants to leave and join another company, sometimes they have to spend six months on Garden Leave. It's called garden, hanging out in the garden, basically. And like this is not a good use of people's time. I mean, if they want us to hang out on the garden, that's fine, but they shouldn't have to.
Philippe Houchois: Thank you.
Elon Musk: I mean, those are now Europe. We know what we're talking about.
Martin Viecha: Philippe, do we have a follow-up question?
Philippe Houchois: No. That’s fine. Thank you very much.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you very much, everyone, for joining this call, and thank you for all your good questions. And we'll speak to you again in about three months
Elon Musk: Yes, maybe sooner with battery. Okay, thanks.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."

Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for standing by and welcome to the ON Semiconductor Second Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker for today, Mr. Parag Agarwal. Sir, please go ahead.
Parag Agarwal - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Thank you, Jay. Good morning and thank you for joining ON Semiconductor Corporation's second quarter 2020 quarterly results conference call. I am joined today by Keith Jackson, our President and CEO; and Bernard Gutmann, our CFO. This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.onsemi.com. A replay of this webcast along with our 2020 second quarter earnings release will be available on our website approximately one hour following this conference call, and the recorded webcast will be available for approximately 30 days following this conference call. The script for today's call and additional information related to our end markets, business segments, geographies, channels, share count and 2020 and 2021 fiscal calendars are also posted on our website. Our earnings release and this presentation includes certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable measures under GAAP are included in our earnings release which is posted separately on our website in the Investor Relations section. During the course of this conference call, we'll make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. The words believe, estimate, project, anticipate, intend, may, expect, will, plan, should or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risk and uncertainties that could cause actual events or results to differ materially from projections. Important factors which can affect our business, including factors that could cause actual results to differ from our forward-looking statements are described in our Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs and other filings with Securities and Exchange Commission. Additional factors are described in our earnings release for the second quarter of 2020. Our estimates or other financial – or other forward-looking statements may change, and the company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, changed assumptions or other factors except as required by law. We plan to host our Analyst Day on March 5, 2021. At this time, our intent is to hold the event virtually. However, if conditions improve and risks related to COVID-19 pandemic subside substantially, we will hold the event in person in Phoenix, Arizona. We will provide additional information on the event in due course. During the third quarter, we plan to attend four virtual conferences. This includes Keybank Capital Markets Future of Technology Series on August 11; Jefferies Virtual Semiconductor IT, Hardware and Communications Infrastructure Summit on September 2; Citi Global Technology Conference on September 10; and Deutsche Bank Technology Conference on September 15. Now let me turn it over to Bernard Gutmann who will provide an overview of our second quarter 2020 results. Bernard?
Bernard Gutmann - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Thank you, Parag, and thank you everyone for joining us today. During the second quarter, we saw a moderate improvement in business conditions as macroeconomic activity picked up across the world. We're seeing improvement in order activity across most end markets and geographies as the global community adjusts to changed business and social conditions brought about by the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a significant headwind to our results. However, through strong execution and unwavering commitment from our employees, customers and supply chain partners, we believe that we are successful in navigating the current environment. Despite near-term challenges, long-term drivers of our business remain intact. We're seeing strong momentum in our key end markets driven by accelerating design wins for our power, analog and sensor products. At this time, improving our gross margin is the primary strategic priority for the company. As evidenced from our most recent press releases, we have accelerated our plans to optimize our manufacturing network. In addition, we're making strong progress in the ramp of our 300-millimeter manufacturing processes at East Fishkill fab. Keith will later provide additional details regarding our progress on the manufacturing front in his remarks. Now let me provide you with details on our second quarter 2020 results. Total revenue for the second quarter of 2020 was $1.213 billion, a decrease of 10% as compared to revenues of $1.348 billion in the second quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decline in revenue was driven primarily by a slowdown in global macroeconomic activity due to the COVID-19 pandemic. GAAP net loss for the quarter was $0.00 per diluted share as compared to a net income of $0.24 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP net income for the second quarter of 2020 was $0.12 per diluted share as compared to $0.42 per diluted share in the second quarter of 2019. GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 30.8% as compared to 37% in the second quarter of 2019. Non-GAAP gross margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 30.8% as compared to 37.1% in the second quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decline in gross margin was driven primarily by lower revenue as discussed earlier and COVID-related costs. Second quarter 2020 gross margin included approximately $24 million of COVID-19-related costs. These costs include approximately $13 million related to the underutilization of our factory network in the first half of the second quarter. At this time, we do not expect to incur this underutilization charge in the third quarter of 2020 and beyond. And consequently, we expect to see a substantial increase in our gross margin for the third quarter. Other COVID 19-related costs in the second quarter included higher logistics costs and costs related to the implementation of enhanced health and safety protocols for our employees. Our GAAP operating margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 3.6% as compared to 11.7% in the second quarter of 2019. Our non-GAAP operating margin for the second quarter of 2020 was 7.4% as compared to 15.7% in the second quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decline in operating margin was driven largely by lower revenue and lower gross margin due to the COVID-19 pandemic. GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $331 million as compared to $341 million in the second quarter of 2019. Second quarter GAAP operating expenses included approximately $11.8 million associated with our previously announced restructuring programs. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the second quarter were $284.6 million as compared to $288.2 million in the second quarter of 2019. The year-over-year decrease in non-GAAP operating expenses was driven primarily by strong execution on the cost front and by restructuring and cost-saving measures taken along the way by the company. Second quarter free cash flow was $81.2 million and operating cash flow was $154.5 million. Capital expenditures during the second quarter were $73.3 million which equates to a capital intensity of 6%. Given the current macroeconomic environment, we're directing most of the capital expenditures towards enabling our 300-millimeter capabilities at the East Fishkill fab. We expect total capital expenditures for 2020 to be approximately $400 million. We exited the second quarter of 2020 with cash and cash equivalents of $2.06 billion as compared to $1.982 billion at the end of the first quarter of 2020. At this time, with cash balances of approximately $2 billion, we're very comfortable with our liquidity position. At the end of the second quarter, days of inventory on hand were 140 days, up by nine days as compared to 131 days in the first quarter of 2020. The increase in days of inventory was driven primarily by our expectations of recovery in demand in the second half of the current year. In addition, we want to ensure that we have significant inventory on hand to support our customers in case of any supply disruption. In the second quarter, distribution inventory decreased marginally in terms of weeks of inventory. Now let me provide you with an update on performance of our business units starting with the Power Solutions Group or PSG. Revenue for PSG in the second quarter was $618 million, revenue for Advanced Solutions Group for the second quarter was $427 million and revenue for our Intelligent Sensing Group was $168 million. Now I would like to turn the call over to Keith Jackson for additional comments on the business environment. Keith?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Thanks, Bernard. I will start with structural changes we are making to drive margin expansion and then I will provide an update on current business environment. To drive gross margin expansion, we have accelerated the pace of our manufacturing footprint optimization. We announced a plan to explore potential sale of our 6-inch fab in Niigata, Japan. Production from the Niigata, Japan fab is expected to be transitioned to other fabs in our network. This announcement comes on the heels of our announcement in February regarding our plan to transition production from our 6-inch automotive-centric fab in Belgium. With manufacturing optimization plans we've announced thus far, we expect to see significant improvement in our manufacturing cost structure and gross margin. Our 300-millimeter manufacturing capability in the East Fishkill fab has afforded us significant flexibility which has enabled us to optimize our network. During the second quarter, we started our first 300-millimeter wafer production at the East Fishkill fab. We are currently sampling our 300-millimeter products to customers, and we expect to recognize our first 300-millimeter revenue in the third quarter. As we've noted in our earlier calls, we are very pleased with our accelerated progress in ramping our 300-millimeter manufacturing processes. The yields have been spectacular and we expect to see a meaningful positive impact on our gross margins as our 300-millimeter manufacturing ramps up in the coming years. We've made substantial progress in key initiatives for driving gross margin expansion. We have launched new products and built a robust design win pipeline in automotive, industrial and cloud power end markets to drive richer mix. We continue to optimize our portfolio to ensure healthy margins for the company. We've accelerated the optimization of our manufacturing network. In addition, we will continue to work on expanding our gross margin through operational improvements within our network. As our revenue recovers driven by global macroeconomic recovery and the ramp-up of design wins, we expect to see strong operating leverage and robust gross margin expansion. Let me now comment on the current business environment. We are beginning to see moderate recovery in the business environment. The improvement is broad-based with improving order activity across most end markets. Unlike in the second quarter, we have not seen any meaningful pushout or cancellation of orders. Based on current outlook, we expect to see improving business trends through the rest of the year. Improvement in our business is driven not only by improving global macroeconomic environment but also by our accelerating design wins in automotive, industrial and cloud power end markets. Our customers are restarting their factories and are engaging with our teams on ongoing projects. Our factories are resuming normal operation, and at this time we don't expect to see any meaningful supply constraints in the current quarter and beyond. From a geographic perspective, we're seeing recovery in demand from Americas and Europe as economic activity has improved in these regions, and we're very encouraged by improving PMI numbers from both Europe and the US. We are beginning to see signs of recovery in automotive demand from Europe and the US while demand from China and Asia remains healthy. Despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we continue to make progress towards our strategic and financial goals. Key secular mega-trends and long-term drivers of our business remain intact. We're seeing accelerating momentum in key strategic initiatives for electric vehicles, robotics, factory and warehouse automation, cloud power and ADAS. Customers are increasingly relying on us to provide enabling technologies in power, analog and sensors, and they value the differentiation in technology and quality our products offer. Now I'll provide details of the progress in our various end markets for the second quarter of 2020. Revenue for the automotive market in the second quarter was $327 million and represented 27% of our revenue in the second quarter. Second quarter automotive revenue declined 26% year-over-year. Year-over-year decline in automotive market was driven primarily by the closure of automotive production factories in various parts of the world due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Although the COVID-19 pandemic caused a temporary slowdown in our automotive revenue, key secular drivers powering our business have remained intact. Our content in the fastest growing automotive applications continues to grow at a healthy pace. Based on our design win pipeline, indications from customers and revenue trends, we believe that we are gaining significant share in the most attractive segments of the automotive semiconductor market. We're beginning to see recovery in the automotive market in the US and Europe. Conversations with customers indicate that we should see ongoing recovery in the third and in the fourth quarter of the current year. We are seeing strong momentum for our silicon carbide and silicon products for electric vehicles. We recently won a very significant design with one of the leading global automotive OEMs for our silicon carbide power module for traction inverters for electric vehicles. We expect to start seeing revenue from this win a year from now. Based on our current engagement with various automotive OEMs, we expect to win multiple designs in the near to mid-term. With a broad portfolio of silicon and silicon carbide products and industry-leading module capabilities, we believe that we are uniquely positioned to be a strong leader in power semiconductor market for electric vehicles. We expect to see strong revenue growth in our IGBT modules for EV traction inverters as our design wins ramp in China this year. In ADAS, we continue to win designs for our CMOS image sensors with leading global OEMs. Our competitive position in automotive CMOS image sensors remain solid and our customers value our technology leadership and breadth of product offerings in this market. We are seeing strong customer interest in our recently introduced backside illumination image sensors for automotive applications. We are making strong progress in LIDAR and we expect to commence commercial shipments of our LIDAR products in mid to late 2021. During the second quarter, we also secured major design wins for surround vision applications. We expect to begin seeing revenue from these wins in mid-2021. Our ability to integrate our automotive sensor products with our analog and power products, coupled with our deep automotive systems expertise has provided us with a very formidable competitive advantage. Customers continue to place very high value on our ability to provide complete solutions for various automotive sensor applications. Revenue in the third quarter of 2020 for the automotive end market is expected to be up strongly quarter-over-quarter as we expect to see worldwide recovery in automotive production. The industrial end market which includes military, aerospace and medical contributed revenue of $348 million in the second quarter. The industrial end market represented 29% of our revenue in the second quarter. Year-over-year, our second quarter industrial revenue declined 3%. This decline was driven by a reduction in global industry activity and supply constraints due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We're seeing strong traction for our silicon carbide products in industrial power applications with an expanding base of customers. Recently, we announced a win with Delta for our silicon carbide power modules for solar inverter applications. Demand for industrial automation continues to grow at a rapid pace. We've secured major design wins for our image sensors for industrial applications, and we expect revenue from these wins to be recognized in late 2020. We continue to secure design wins for our large-format sensors in diverse industrial applications. We're engaged with leading global players on many warehouse, automation and robotic delivery products. We expect that e-commerce customers will be a key driver of our growth of industrial revenue in a year's timeframe. As is the case in the automotive market, we leverage our broad company-wide portfolio and customer relationship to secure design wins for our sensor products in the industrial market. We continue to make strong progress in industrial IoT space and are on track to launch our first industrial IoT connectivity product incorporating Wi-Fi technology from our Quantenna acquisition within a year. Revenue in the third quarter of 2020 for the industrial end market is expected to be down quarter-over-quarter. Geopolitical issues related to a specific customer have adversely impacted our third quarter industrial revenue. We don't expect any further meaningful decline in revenue from this customer beyond the third quarter. The communications end market which includes both networking and wireless, contributed revenue of $255 million in the quarter and represented 21% of our revenue during the second quarter. Second quarter communications revenue increased by 3% year-over-year. We saw strong year-over-year growth in our 5G business in the second quarter. On the smartphone front, we continue to increase our content in most popular platforms. Revenue in the third quarter of 2020 for the communications end market is expected to be down quarter-over-quarter. Our third quarter communications revenue has been impacted by delayed launches of certain platforms and geopolitical issues related to a specific customer. We don't expect any further meaningful decline in revenue from this customer beyond the third quarter. The computing end market contributed revenue of $158 million in the second quarter. The computing end market represented 13% of our revenue in the second quarter. Second quarter computing revenue increased by 14% year-over-year due to strength in both server and client businesses. Revenue in the third quarter of 2020 for the computing end market is expected to be up quarter-over-quarter. We expect growth in both server and client parts of the computing business. The consumer end market contributed revenue of $126 million in the second quarter. The consumer end market represented 10% of our revenue in the second quarter. Second quarter consumer revenue declined by 22% year-over-year. The year-over-year decline was due to broad-based weakness in consumer electronics market due to COVID-19 pandemic and our selective participation in this market. Revenue for the third quarter of 2020 for the consumer end market is expected to be up quarter-over-quarter due to normal seasonality. In summary, gross margin expansion is a key strategic priority for the company. We have accelerated the pace of our manufacturing footprint optimization with the goal to drive significant gross margin expansion. Ramp of our 300-millimeter manufacturing processes at East Fishkill fab should further help in gross margin expansion. In the near-term, the expected decline in COVID-19-related expenses and impact of cost realignment measures should help expand margins. We've seen moderate improvement in business conditions to-date and we expect that this improvement should continue in the near-term. We're seeing broad-based recovery across most end markets and geographies. Key secular mega-trends and long-term drivers of our business remain intact and we are excited about our medium to long-term prospects. We're seeing accelerating momentum in our key strategic initiatives for electric vehicles, robotics, factory and warehouse automation, cloud power and ADAS. As COVID-19-related impact subsides, we expect to see meaningful improvement in revenue growth and margin expansion. Now I would like to turn it back over to Bernard for forward-looking guidance. Bernard?
Bernard Gutmann - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Thank you, Keith. Based on product booking trends, backlog levels and estimated turns levels, we anticipate that total ON Semiconductor revenue will be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.33 billion in the third quarter of 2020. Our third quarter revenue has been impacted moderately by geopolitical issues related to a particular customer. At this time, near to mid-term expectations related to this customer have been de-risked to a large extent and we don't expect to see any further meaningful decline in revenue from this customer beyond the third quarter. For third quarter of 2020, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin between 32% to 34%. Our third quarter gross margin outlook includes COVID-19-related costs of approximately $11 million. We expect total GAAP operating expenses of $307 million to $327 million. Our GAAP operating expenses include the amortization of intangibles, restructuring, asset impairments and other charges which are expected to be $30 million to $34 million. We expect total non-GAAP operating expenses of $277 million to $293 million in the third quarter. We anticipate third quarter of 2020 GAAP net other income and expense including interest expense will be an expense of $42 million to $45 million which includes a non-cash interest expense of $9 million to $10 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP net other income and expense including interest expense will be an expense of $33 million to $35 million. Net cash paid for income taxes in the third quarter of 2020 is expected to be $17 million to $22 million. For 2020, we expect cash paid for taxes to be in the range of $54 million to $60 million. We expect total capital expenditures of $80 million to $90 million in the third quarter of 2020. We're currently targeting an overwhelming proportion of our CapEx for enabling our 300-millimeter capability at an accelerated pace. For 2020, we expect total capital expenditures of approximately $400 million. We also expect share-based compensation of $17 million to $19 million in the third quarter of 2020, of which approximately $2 million is expected to be in the cost of goods sold, and the remaining amount is expected to be in operating expenses. This expense is included in our non-GAAP financial measures. Our GAAP diluted shares for the third quarter of 2020 is expected to be 460 million shares based on our current stock price. Our non-GAAP diluted share count for the third quarter of 2020 is expected to be 411 million shares based on our current stock price. Further details on share count and earnings per share calculations are provided regularly in our quarterly and annual reports on Form 10-Q and Form 10-K respectively. With that, I would like to start the Q&A session. Thank you. And Jay, please open the line for questions.
Operator: Thank you, sir. The first question comes from the line of Ross Seymore of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Hi, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. First question I had is on the gross margin line. It's good to see no negative surprises on that for the first time in a couple quarters. So I just wanted to look at, in the near-term, how you expect those COVID-related charges to trend. You still have a bit in the third quarter. Do they go away in the fourth quarter? And then much more importantly, longer-term, with the Belgium fab and the Niigata fab potentially being sold or shut down, how do we think about the long-term gross margin potential? When do those benefits come in? What's your new target, etcetera?
Bernard Gutmann - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Thank you, Ross. Let me first address the – the COVID-related expenses is a little bit difficult to predict exactly when those are going to go away. As we said, a lot of those are related to freight expenses which are at a premium right now as well as safety protocols that we have put in place. Obviously, it will be a function of how the COVID pandemic progresses over time, and we expect those gradually to come down, but we are projecting that those will continue during the third quarter. We have typically assessed the savings associated with a 6-inch fab to be in the $25 million to $30 million of fixed costs that go away per year. The timing of the savings is really a function of business dynamics, and we don't have a perfect timeline from the time we conclude a sale. It will still take us probably about 1 to 1.5 years until we get full savings, but that depends on really when we get these deals concluded. Long-term, we still are aspiring and still are targeting to achieve our long-term goal of 43% that we enumerated in our 2019 Analyst Day, albeit probably a little bit delayed with the fact that 2019 and 2020 were obviously not very good years from a top line point of view.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks for the color. And then my follow-up, I just wanted to hit on the revenue side. In the last couple quarters, you talked about supply disruptions, and I think everybody understands that. But they were, in the first quarter, a bit over $100 million; I think it was about the same in the second quarter is what you originally said. So did you have those supply disruptions impacting revenue in the second quarter? And then potentially more importantly, if you don't have any in the third quarter, are those revenues just gone? Or like so many of your peers, are you actually expecting to catch up on some of the formerly delinquent shipping?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: So we did continue to have supply constraints or pandemic-induced supply constraints in the second quarter that was reflected in the total numbers. They are much less in the third quarter and we're hopeful that there will be none before the end of the year. But at this stage, again, everything is still unknown if there's flare-ups or changes around the world; there's still risk.
Ross Seymore - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Chris Danely of Citigroup. Your line is open.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Thanks, guys. First question is you managed to do a really good job keeping the OpEx down in Q2, and you're – you've given us some good guidance for Q3. How about longer-term trends in OpEx with some of these restructuring plans? What can we expect for the next, I guess, several quarters?
Bernard Gutmann - ON Semiconductor Corp.: So, indeed, we did take some significant actions that helped us over-achieve our second quarter and third quarter guidance. In the long run, we're still targeting to achieve the 21% of OpEx as we have enumerated in our Analyst Day. However, we have to be aware that at some point of time, depending on business conditions, some of the temporary actions as well as some of the variable comp will come back and will cause a temporary blip that will be gradually leveraged through as we increase revenues.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. And then for my follow-up, any commentary or color on the Koch Industries' investment? Why did you adopt the shareholder rights program? And do you expect them to be a passive or active shareholder?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: They have indicated publicly their passive intent as a shareholder and had no further communication.
Christopher Brett Danely - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Chris Caso of Raymond James. Your line is open.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes. Thank you. Good morning. I wonder if you can comment on the linearity of bookings through the quarter, and it sounds like you're expecting some improvements as you go through the end of the year. If you could elaborate on that a little bit more. Thank you.
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Yeah. We had good linear pickup through the entire second quarter and we continue to see good activity here in the third. So at this stage, we don't know when they stop ramping. But so far, it's been quite strong since the middle of the second quarter.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: And what about with regard to Q4 seasonality? And I guess given all the ups and downs we've had this year, I'm not sure that that normal seasonality generally applies. But any thoughts on how we should be thinking about the quarter in light of all what's going on right now?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Yeah. In our comments, we mentioned we expected conditions to continue to improve. We really only give guidance one quarter at a time, but we see no reason to believe there should be any retraction of the current trends.
Chris Caso - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Raji Gill from Needham & Company. Your line is open.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you for taking my questions. Congrats to the accelerated transition to 300-millimeter; I think that's very good progress. If you could remind us the cost savings, the potential cost savings as you transition to 300-millimeter. I believe that 12-inch facility has a revenue capacity of about $2.2 billion or about 40% of your revenue. So I'm just wondering if you can maybe outline what are the cost savings – what would the cost savings be once you ultimately transition to 300-millimeter? And given kind of the accelerated timeline you've had, and you're starting to see revenue from a 300-millimeter customer in the third quarter, should we expect the transition to happen a little bit sooner than later? Thank you.
Bernard Gutmann - ON Semiconductor Corp.: So the first question on the long-term benefit of East Fishkill, definitely a 300-millimeter fab gives us a sizable good improvement in gross margin, somewhere in that 20% to 25% of total finished goods cost. Now obviously, that is when you have a fully-loaded fab. In the interim period, we are paying a foundry cost, so the savings that we get are simply a function of the price that we're getting. We do and are very excited about loading the fab. As Keith mentioned in his prepared remarks, we're seeing wonderful yields as we're running it through, and we expect to have first revenues in the third quarter. However, meaningful revenues will come in the years to come. Now having said that, even the foundry costs that we're getting from them is quite attractive.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you. And as for my follow-up, we're starting to see a recovery in automotive, particularly in US and Europe. Wondering if you could discuss kind of what's your view on global auto production ending this year? And are there any thoughts in terms of what the rebound could look like in 2021?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Yeah. I guess we don't have any firm opinions on 2021 yet. But I would expect that if you don't have the shutdowns that we had in 2020, there's a very significant improvement year-on-year for next year. We're looking at something in the minus 20% in automotive sales decline year-on-year in 2020. Time will tell, but all of our customers are telling us they're pretty much back to full capacity sometime during the third quarter of this year.
Rajvindra S. Gill - Needham & Co. LLC: All right. Very good. Thank you
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Vijay Rakesh from Mizuho. Your line is open.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Yeah. Hi, guys. Just a couple of questions, one on the automotive side. I think you mentioned LIDAR will be shipping in 2021. Just wondering what your expectations are there second half. And also, on the EV silicon carbide, now that it's ramping, are you still trying to do internal silicon carbide wafers or would this be mostly all external? And how do you see that ramp into next year given it looks like multiple catalysts or subsidies on the EV side going forward? Thanks.
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Okay. Yes. Automotive LIDAR would be in the launches for vehicle OEMs in the second half of next year with the new launches they've got after the summer, and we do expect to see a significant contribution. On the EV side, with silicon carbide, our intent is to have both internal and external supply on an ongoing basis. This year and next year, it should be mostly external supplies and then as you transition to 2022 a larger percent of internal supply.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Got it. And I think you mentioned one customer delay with geopolitical tensions. Is that the same customer that's impacting you on the industrial and the comms side? That's it. Thanks.
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Yeah. It's a very large customer in China that is a broad-based customer and it impacted several of the segments.
Vijay Raghavan Rakesh - Mizuho Securities USA LLC: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland from Susquehanna. Your line is open.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Hi, guys. Some questions about Niigata, I guess. What is the revenue contribution there? And then how are you guys looking at the odds of successfully selling that facility? Thank you.
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: So we actually are expecting to have success there. We've seen good progress with interest in our Belgium factory. And so these assets still have interest in the marketplace and we're expecting to have good results. Percentage of revenue, I'm not sure I have that number.
Bernard Gutmann - ON Semiconductor Corp.: While we probably don't have a precise number. It is a relatively small facility compared to the total footprint. As I mentioned earlier, the savings that we'll get that from that facility is around $30 million per year.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Understood. For the remainder of your capacity, you still have quite a bit of extra there. Have you considered serving new products, some sort of fab filler product or something like that in fact growing out of your footprint organically? Or have you even considered the foundry model? I know you're doing that on a temp basis at Fishkill. I wonder if you could also give us an update on those temporary foundry customers that you have. Have they actually decided to continue with you as well? But, yeah, how you can fill that extra capacity would be great.
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Yeah. So I'll try and get at what I think your question is. We do foundry services for many customers that are generally specialty processes that use our analog and sensor capabilities. They're not temporary; they're permanent relationships that we have with those customers. We continue to be excited by servicing them. As far as looking at low-margin products to fill up factories, we're not looking at that. We don't think we need to look at that. We think the demands that we've talked about coming up for their power products, our sensor products will more than meet the needed amount of ramp over the next few years. So the trends in electric vehicles, in factory and automation, etcetera, we've been talking about, we think they're more than sufficient. And then with the closure of two of our wafer fabs, we believe the balance in the medium-term will be quite good.
Christopher Rolland - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP: Thanks, guys.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Craig Ellis of B. Riley FBR. Your line is open.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks for taking the question and, guys, thanks for all the color on COGS initiatives. I just wanted to follow-up on a few of the fabs questions. Keith, so from your last question, can we deduce that there are no other fabs that the company would sell if we don't have a strong recovery? Or are there some things that you could execute on if we had a lackluster rather than a strong recovery?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Yeah. We have no current plans. The outlook that we've got right now, we think the remaining network is appropriate. But as always, we will see what the future holds.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: Got it. And then perhaps touching on two end market issues with one question. One, it looks like compute in the third quarter will be back to record highs. Can you give us a sense for how the mix of PC versus server power is evolving therein? And then with auto, I know you don't want to give a specific outlook for calendar 2021. But do you feel with all the design wins you have in your secular growth areas that exiting 2021 that business could be back towards prior record levels? Thanks for the help, guys.
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: So yes, we're seeing good results there and I think I would give kind of two pieces of color. One, the infrastructure piece for the cloud continues to grow and we see very sharp growth there. We think there was certainly some COVID-related acceleration on the client side. We don't see that diminishing here this year. We think that continues with a lot of the remote learning and remote interactions that are going on, people continuing to upgrade various parts of their appliance systems. So I would say as we enter into the first quarter of next year, we still see a strong compute environment and should expect next year to be as good, if not better from a growth perspective.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: And then on automotive?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Automotive, certainly, we've seen major interruptions as you know in the first part of the year with manufacturing. As I mentioned, our customers are telling us that they are full steam ahead here as they've gone into Q3. And in each of those major customers around the world, their efforts in electric vehicles are accelerating and their efforts from an ADAS perspective are accelerating. So we are expecting to see a return to the above-market growth for our products in automotive next year.
Craig A. Ellis - B. Riley FBR, Inc.: That's helpful. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay of Cowen. Your line is open.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC: Yes. Thank you very much. Good morning everybody. Keith, I wanted to follow-up on some of the PC and server power stuff. There's been some fairly big disruptions with one of the big microprocessor suppliers there and their future roadmap. And I just wondered maybe you could step back and tell us how you guys are aligned on the server power side regardless of chip vendor or of OEM or ODM mix and if that might change any of your forward outlook there. Thank you.
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: No. We're well-aligned with the various processor options for PCs and servers and very well-aligned with the model changes that they have in their portfolio. So we frankly think that it does change things for them, but from our perspective all of them still need power and we're well-positioned.
Matthew D. Ramsay - Cowen & Co. LLC: All right, great. Thanks for the help there. And just as a follow-up, I guess you're one year on from closing Quantenna now. And if you just kind of step back and look where the design win traction has been and maybe the revenue trends since you closed the deal, just kind of level-set where you were versus your expectation, I think that would be helpful. Thank you very much, guys.
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Okay. On the Quantenna, we are not achieving the revenue growth we had hoped. Certainly, the market events have had an impact on that. We are quite excited about the progress we're making with our new combination products for the appliance market, and the teams there on the engineering side trying to drive a low-power combination product for that market are making great progress. So what we're seeing out there is good excitement for the future designs but less revenue than we had hoped for originally.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan. Your line is open.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Within the Intelligent Sensing Group, we tend to focus on the automotive piece which is the largest segment growing at a double-digit CAGR. But it looks like the industrial and edge applications are seeing strong adoption – robotics, machine vision, smart retail. So excluding some of the legacy businesses, do you guys still see a double-digit growth CAGR in industrial and edge over the next few years? And what's the current mix of industrial and edge within ISG?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: So we do see a lot of strong growth coming. It's been offset by our pulling back from some of the very low-margin consumer-like security business, security cameras for homes, etcetera. So that's masked some of the great growth, but we're seeing the adoption there in the industrial area, in the automation area and in the robotics area actually pretty exciting. So we are expecting double-digit growth for all of those portions of the market and of course in automotive to continue. So after seeing the COVID impact this year plus some retraction from some of the security business, I would expect to see that double digits returning in 2021.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Yeah. Thanks for the insights there. And then on the cloud power, obviously benefiting from the strong cloud server spending trends, but especially in servers you guys are seeing a strong pickup in dollar content. I think it's been about like a 15% CAGR on dollar content over the past four years on the server platforms. You've got Sapphire Rapids from Intel ramping next year. I think you guys are anticipating about 25% dollar content step-up on the upgrade. Is that still how you kind of see dollar content improvements on a go-forward basis?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Yeah. We're seeing it go from about $60 to $75 next year is our expectation, growth per server.
Harlan Sur - JPMorgan Securities LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of John Pitzer of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Yeah. Good morning, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Keith, I'm just kind of curious. You talked about the impact of the geopolitical in Q3. Can you quantify it? And in your prepared comments, you said that you think it's now been fully de-risked. Is that customer effectively now zero? And are you concerned that to-date the US has just been targeting a single entity in China? What are the risks if that broadens out?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Yeah. We are very concerned about some of the increasing tensions on global trade. Very much believe that global trade is essential for technology and the growth of semiconductors. So clearly, would not like to see further there. We don't comment on specific customers, but the answer is no. It's not zero our revenue expectations from China or those customers. But the pieces that look likely to be impacted we think have all been impacted at this stage.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: That's helpful. And then Keith, as you guys ramp the 300-millimeter Fishkill facility, I'd be curious as to what end markets we should think about that fab supporting. And you've been a long-standing member of the SIA. I'd be curious to get your view of the CHIPS Act. Post the sale of the fab in Japan and in Belgium, what percent of your capacity is going to be US-based and how might that help you in the future if the CHIPS Act is passed especially around tax rate?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Okay. Two separate questions there. On the 300-millimeter, the market's there. We're ramping up initially power products, so all of the server and automotive and industrial applications that we talk about growing are going to be filling that up with power products, and then that will be followed afterwards with more and more sensor and analog products. The CHIPS Act we think is an important part of balancing out the supply chain. For ON Semiconductor, we actually have several facilities already here in the US. And with the addition of East Fishkill, the vast majority of our wafers will be coming out of the United States.
John W. Pitzer - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC: Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of David O'Connor of Exane BNP Paribas. Your line is open.
David O'Connor - Exane BNP Paribas: Great. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. Maybe one or two follow-ups from some previous answers. Keith, you spoke about improved order activity in most end markets and geographies. Which are the end markets that are still impacted or still seeing pockets of weakness? And also in orders, the long lead time orders, has visibility there improved too or is it more just the short lead term (sic) [time] (00:51:20) orders? And I have a follow-up. Thanks.
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Yeah. I'll start in reverse order. From the lead time orders and impact we're seeing there, clearly customers are using those lead times to place their orders. So we don't see any increase in long-term orders from a normal pattern; in fact, if anything a little bit less of that and more of the order as our lead times dictate. Relative to where we still see some softness, in general, as I mentioned, the handset business looks like it's going to be re-ramping later this year rather than earlier. And some of the business I mentioned earlier with security and industrial in China is a little bit softer than it was in Q2.
David O'Connor - Exane BNP Paribas: Thanks. That's helpful. And then maybe as my follow-up. It sounds like you're accelerating traction on silicon carbide with some of the inverter wins that you mentioned. When you look at your overall design wins on silicon carbide, what's the phasing of those wins when we look out over the next maybe three years, starting in 2021? Is the bulk of those wins ramping in 2022 or is it more spread out over the next three years? Thank you.
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: So yeah. We have ramps every year and the accelerate, I would say significant acceleration in 2022. But we're actually starting to ramp here at the end of this year, through all of next year, but I'd say the biggest impact is 2022.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Tristan Gerra of Baird. Your line is open.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Hi. Good morning. Longer-term structural question on gross margin. I understand the low utilization rates and the COVID-related charges. But your gross margin earlier this year came down below the 2011-2012 which I think was around 32% at the time and yet your revenue base was about one-third lower than it is now. So is that mostly attributed to ramping capacity in 2018 or are there mix or pricing effects as well? And also, what was the pricing decline year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter in the just-reported quarter?
Bernard Gutmann - ON Semiconductor Corp.: So we attribute the impact mostly due to COVID and due to the underutilization that's driven by as a result of that. Long-term, we still are aiming and we are confident that we can achieve that long-term goal of 43%. We don't see any pricing issues as we go through. Pricing has been pretty healthy. I think that's it.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Okay. And then any update that we should get on your acquisition strategy? Is that something that is basically going to remain unchanged with what we've seen in the past decade or is there any changes as a result of the environment and the manufacturing shift that's ongoing right now at the company?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: So no change in basic philosophy. When the time is right and the opportunities are right, we certainly will be an interested party. But at this stage, there's no activity.
Tristan Gerra - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.: Great. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Kevin Cassidy of Rosenblatt Securities. Your line is open.
Kevin Edward Cassidy - Rosenblatt Securities: Thanks for taking my question. When you announced the acquisition of the East Fishkill fab, you had said it was about $300 million in investments you're going to make into the fab. Out of the $400 million in your CapEx for this year, how much of that is going towards the $300 million for East Fishkill?
Bernard Gutmann - ON Semiconductor Corp.: It is a significant portion of it that we are devoting and that should really give us the ability to ramp-up in a faster and more meaningful way.
Kevin Edward Cassidy - Rosenblatt Securities: Okay. Great. And in the Niigata fab, what process nodes were being run there?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Those were mostly analog nodes for various mixed-signal products, and the markets for that were everything from automotive to consumer.
Kevin Edward Cassidy - Rosenblatt Securities: Okay. Great. Thank you. Congratulations on the progress.
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Gary Mobley, Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.
Gary Mobley - Wells Fargo Securities LLC: Yeah. Thanks. Good morning. Thanks for fitting in everybody. In the interest of time, I'll pose both my questions. I'm curious to know how the potential divestiture or sale of the Niigata fab might impact any relationship that you have with some Japan-based automotive OEMs. And Bernard, you mentioned that distributor inventory was down a little quarter-over-quarter. Remind us of how far you need to go before you're back into your long-term range goal, and would you expect that distributor inventory to decrease again in the third quarter?
Bernard Gutmann - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Yeah. So I'll take that question before – so we are at the high end of our guide, so we're not really outside of our bounds. We also build the inventory in anticipation of a recovery, so that should help us to serve customers in the third and fourth quarter.
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Yeah. And on the relationships, clearly value our customers and we're going to make sure that the transitions there do not impact them. We have a much larger 8-inch facility in Aizu, Japan. And so what we intend to do is use that for those customers in Japan that need that continuity of local supply.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Nik Todorov of Longbow Research. Your line is open.
Nikolay Todorov - Longbow Research LLC: Hi. Thanks, guys. I wonder – I think last quarter, you announced a $50 million cost saving program. I just wonder how much of that has gone through and how much is left to go.
Bernard Gutmann - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Well, we did accelerate and did that. So our guidance for the third quarter shows that we are continuing to be at the low point that we achieved in the second quarter. So for the most part, it's done.
Nikolay Todorov - Longbow Research LLC: Okay. Great. And a follow-up quickly. I think the gross margin – the free cash flow generation was much stronger than expected. I wonder if you have any thoughts on how should we think about 2020 outlook for free cash flow, and then any thoughts on resuming the buyback.
Bernard Gutmann - ON Semiconductor Corp.: So at this stage, on a prudent way, we'll still keep the share buyback program on hold. We're still prudent on that front. That will be for later on. The free cash flow, we talked about our CapEx being $80 million to $90 million for the third quarter and $400 million for the year, and the rest should come directly from the P&L. Don't expect any other significant disruptions in the free cash flow, so it should be mainly a result of the P&L minus the CapEx of $80 million to $90 million in the third quarter and $400 million for the year.
Nikolay Todorov - Longbow Research LLC: Got it. Thanks.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya of Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.
Vivek Arya - BofA Securities, Inc.: Thanks for taking my question. I think, Keith, you mentioned that automotive customers will be at full production rates in Q3. I just wanted to make sure if I heard that properly. Or the real question behind that is how far below do you think your auto customers are below their prior peaks of production, and how does that compare to your automotive sales versus the prior peak?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Yeah. So my comment there is that during the third quarter, they should all reach full production. They weren't all full production from day one, so that's going to vary a bit by end customer. But like I said, they're all bullish of getting back to what they consider full production during the third quarter.
Vivek Arya - BofA Securities, Inc.: But if they are at full production, then why are your automotive revenues still 15%, 20% below your prior peaks?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: I'll try again. So they aren't full production for the entire quarter; they're achieving full production rates during the quarter. So they're still ramping I guess is the simple way to interpret that.
Vivek Arya - BofA Securities, Inc.: Got it. Thanks. And as a quick follow-up, if say conceptually your Q4 sales are flattish, should we assume that gross margins also stay flattish or are there other trends that could take them higher or lower?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: So I'm not postulating on revenues in Q4, but you should see continued improvement on the gross margin front as the expenses around COVID go down and we continue to get traction in our factories from Q2 levels.
Vivek Arya - BofA Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Shawn Harrison of Loop Capital. Your line is open.
Shawn M. Harrison - Loop Capital Markets: Hi. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Keith, I want to go back to auto as well but more of – it looks like in the first quarter, ON outperformed production by about 15 points; it was about 20 points in the second quarter. It looks like you picked up $5 to $7 of content per vehicle on average this year. Just maybe you could highlight where you've seen the content increase year-over-year and do you expect – I mean, I know it's typically a high single-digit outperformance in production, but it looks like you'll be well ahead of that down 20% for the year if this content trend continues.
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Yeah. As I mentioned, the two trends on electrification and the ADAS, the safety side, continue to drive more dollar content for us. And as you pointed out, I think it's showing up in less declines than the marketplace overall as opposed to big gains. So hopefully as the market turns around, you'll see those turn into big gains. But it really is electric power in the EV side and all of the ADAS applications starting to grow that continues to drive those trends.
Shawn M. Harrison - Loop Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you. And then Bernard, did you say you would expect internal inventory dollars to decline sequentially in the third quarter or was that just distribution?
Bernard Gutmann - ON Semiconductor Corp.: We expect distribution down and we expect to remain probably flattish in terms of inventory dollars in the third quarter but down in terms of days.
Shawn M. Harrison - Loop Capital Markets: Okay. Thank you very much.
Operator: Thank you. Next question comes from the line of Craig Hettenbach of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Yes. Thanks. Keith, just a question on EVs. Since you do both IGBTs as well silicon carbide, I just want to get a sense of how you're seeing that market develop. And particularly from a silicon carbide adoption, what are some of the signals you're getting from customers that they're moving forward versus that trade-off with IGBTs?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: We're still seeing the predominance of the lower-cost vehicles go IGBT and the high-end vehicles going to silicon carbide is the trend that we're seeing, a very definite bifurcation going on there, and that is geography-independent. So we think there will be good growth in both sectors going forward.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Got it. And then just a follow-up to some of the questions that have been asked on the geopolitical issues. Do you have a rough sense so you can quantify roughly for Q3 what the impact is to the guidance? And then do you think there were any pull-forwards ahead of that to Q4 as those issues arose?
Keith D. Jackson - ON Semiconductor Corp.: So I'll start with the end of that. We're not expecting any additional issues there. We think that the new rule is kind of at a pause for a bit, so I'm not expecting any further impacts or surprises on that number. I don't know that we've got a number we're prepared to handle because it is a specific customer and we don't share that type of information.
Craig M. Hettenbach - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thanks.
Operator: There are no further question at this time. Presenters, you may proceed.
Parag Agarwal - ON Semiconductor Corp.: Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. We look forward to seeing you at various conferences during the quarter. Goodbye.
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect. Have a great day."
4909,TSLA,2,2023,2023-07-19 21:33:10,"Martin Viecha: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla’s Second Quarter 2023 Q&A Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations. And I’m joined today by Elon Musk, Zachary Kirkhorn, and a number of other executives. Our Q2 results were announced at about 3:00 pm Central Time in the update deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today’s call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?
Elon Musk: Thank you, Martin. So, just a Q2 recap. In Q2 we achieved record vehicle production and deliveries, and record revenue of about $25 billion in a single quarter. And Model Y became the bestselling vehicle of any kind globally in Q1, surpassing the likes of Corolla and Golf. So, it was the number one vehicle of any kind, including vehicles that are sold at a far lower price. This is, I think, an incredible achievement by the Tesla team, and just a huge thank you to our customers for their support. And this came in spite of high interest rates and a lot of macro uncertainty. And nonetheless, we managed to achieve operating margin of about 10%. We continue to target 1.8 million vehicle deliveries this year. Although, we expect that Q3 production will be a little bit down because we’ve got summer shutdowns to -- for a lot of factory upgrades. So, just probably a slight decrease in production in Q3 for sort of global factory upgrades. In the long-term, autonomy we think is going to just drive volume through the ceiling next level. And our sort of future robotaxi products -- dedicated robotaxi products we think have like quasi-infinite demand. The way we’re going to manufacture robotaxi is, is also itself a revolution. So, it’s revolutionary design made in a revolutionary way. It’ll be by far the highest units per hour of any vehicle production ever. So, very excited about that. With respect to Autopilot and Dojo, in order to build autonomy, we also need to train our neural net with data from millions of vehicles. The more -- I mean, this has been proven over and over again. The more training data you have, the better the results. And, I mean, there are times where we see basically -- in a neural net, basically it’s sort of at 1 million training examples, it barely works; at 2 million, it slightly works; at 3 million, it’s like wow, okay, we’re seeing something, but then you get like 10 million training examples, it’s like -- it becomes incredible. So, there’s just no substitute for a massive amount of data. And obviously, Tesla has more vehicles on the road that are collecting this data than all of the companies combined by, I think, maybe even an order of magnitude. So, I think we might have 90% of all -- or a very big number. So, the success in AI endeavors is a function of talent, sort of unique data and computing resources. And we have outstanding capabilities in all three arenas. And I really just don’t know how anyone could do what we’re doing, even if they had our software and had our computer, if they did not have the training data. So, speaking of which, our Dojo training computer is designed to significantly reduce the cost of neural net training. It is designed to -- it’s somewhat optimized for the kind of training that we need, which is a video training. So, we just see that the need for neural net training -- again, talking -- speaking of quasi-infinite things, is just enormous. So, I think having -- we expect to use both, NVIDIA and Dojo, to be clear. But there’s -- we just see demand for really vast training resources. And we think we may reach in-house neural net training capability of a 100 exaflops by the end of next year. So, to date, over 300 million miles have been driven using FSD beta. That 300 million mile number is going to seem small very quickly. It’ll soon be billions of miles, then tens of billions of miles. And FSD will go from being as good as a human to then being vastly better than a human. We see a clear path to full self-driving being 10 times safer than the average human driver, so. And between Autopilot, Dojo computer, our inference hardware in the car, which we call sort of Hardware 3, 4, but it’s really dedicated. It’s a high efficiency inference computer that’s in the car and our Optimus robot, Tesla’s clearly at the cutting edge of AI development. With regard to our Cybertruck, we continue to build our release candidates of the Cybertruck on our final production line in Austin. I’m actually here in Austin at the Gigafactory. This is the first truck that we’re aware of that will have four doors over a six foot bed and will fit into a 20-foot garage. So, it’s sort of biggest on the outside, but it’s even bigger on the inside. So it’s -- I think that’s a -- one of the elements of good design is it should feel bigger on the inside than it looks on the outside. And this is no small car, but we really cared about the exterior dimensions of the Cybertruck down to the last millimeter. So just -- we try to get right in the middle of the Goldilocks zone, not too big, not too small and then really maximize the utility of the volume. And we can’t wait to start delivering it later this year. Some other highlights. Our global Supercharging network now stands at over 50,000 -- roughly 50,000 connectors and over 5,000 locations. As I think a lot of people are aware, the Tesla Charging Standard, which we made open source and it’s now called the North American Charging Standard. We’re deeply honored that Ford, GM, Mercedes and many other OEMs have signed up to use our connector and gain access to our charging network. We strongly believe in helping other car companies to accelerate the EV revolution and just trying to do the right thing in general. So, that’s the goal there. Then something I think, I want emphasize, like very strongly, this is a very important point is that Tesla -- just as with the North American Charging Standard, although we’re not license -- in that case not licensing, we’re just making it available, but we are very open to licensing our full self-driving software and hardware to other car companies. And we are already in discussions with -- early discussions with major OEM about using Tesla FSD. So, we’re not trying to keep this to ourselves. We’re more than happy to license it to others. And lastly, our new lithium refinery and cathode facility are progressing well. In conclusion, we continue to focus on making as many cars as we can, while maintaining healthy financials. Our artificial intelligence development is obviously entering a new era and we’re incredibly excited about what’s to come. Our other businesses such as Megapack, Supercharging service and whatnot, all started to become a meaningful contributor to overall profitability this quarter. And then lastly, I’d just like to profusely thank all of our employees who are making a lot of extra effort during uncertain times. Thank you very much for your hard work and the impact you’re making.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much, Elon. And I think Zach has some opening remarks as well.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. Thanks Martin. As Elon mentioned, Q2 was another record quarter of production and deliveries, as well as records in profit for our energy and services and other businesses. Congratulations again to the Tesla team on the continued progress. As we navigate through a period of economic uncertainty, rising interest rates, volatility in consumer confidence and regulatory change, I want to comment on our financial approach. First, the single most important priority is to ensure we are continuing to invest heavily in the core technologies that will drive the long-term value of the business. This includes increasing spending on AI related technologies such as full self-driving, Optimus and Dojo, as well as new products such as Cybertruck, our next generation platform and the Semi, as evidenced by the continued growth in our R&D spend. This also includes continuing our investments in capacity expansion, not only in our vehicle factories, but also our Supercharging network, service, internal applications, and battery processes, as we continue with meaningful capital expenditures to lay this foundation for the future. Second, we continue to work towards our goals of maximizing volumes on both, our vehicle and energy business, but most importantly, doing so in a way that generates the capital to continue our pace of R&D and capital investments. This requires a strong focus on per unit COGS reductions in each of our key businesses, as well as working capital improvements on raw materials, work in process inventory and customer AR, all of which progressed appropriately in Q2. If we look specifically at our automotive business, our gross margin showed a modest reduction and remained healthy, despite action taken to further improve vehicle affordability early in the quarter. We recognized – we realized per unit cost improvements in nearly every category, including material cost and commodities, manufacturing costs and logistics, while also continuing to rapidly increase the build rate in our Austin and Berlin factories. For our energy business, we improved margins and gross profit driven by cost reductions and deal economics, particularly with Megapack. As a reminder, storage volumes are typically volatile sequentially based on the types of projects and their specific revenue recognition milestones. As we look forward to the rest of the year, I want to reiterate Elon’s comments on Q3 volumes driven by planned downtimes for factory upgrades. These upgrades will also carry some amount of factory idle cost. However, we are working to minimize as much as possible. It’s also important to keep in mind the uncertainty in the macro environment, which can impact our execution positively or negatively in the near term. Regardless, we continue to remain dynamic with a focus on fundamental efficiency and a long-term outlook. Congratulations again to everybody on a great quarter.
A - Martin Viecha : Thank you very much, Zach. And let’s go to investor questions. The first question on licensing FSD we’ve already answered. So, let’s go to the second one. The second question is, what is the status of 4680 cells? How far are you from the specs you laid out on Battery Day? When do you expect to achieve what you laid out on Battery Day?
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes. First, I’ll just start with a little bit of a production update. So, in Texas, 4680 cell production increased 80% Q2 over Q1, and the team surpassed 10 million production cells produced here in Texas. So, congrats to the team for that. Their focus on yield reduced our scrap bill by 40% quarter-over-quarter, and that resulted in a 25% reduction in cell COGS. Here in Texas, we’re preparing to launch our Cybertruck cell, which is 10% higher energy density than current production. That was accomplished through process and mechanical design optimization. As we scale Cyber cell production through the end of the year and early next, we should be in a comfortable place on cost per cell. Against our battery energy density targets, the Cyber cell is at our expectations on a like-for-like electrochemistry basis. We’re yet to integrate silicon or in-house cathode production, both reviewed on Battery Day, which do bring significant further energy density and cost improvements, but that is a topic for another day. Lastly, it is important to remember that most of what we focused on a Battery Day was the Tesla-engineered 4680 production system and the improvements we strove to achieve on equipment, factory density, capital cost and utility cost reduction, all of which we are realizing in our Texas scale up to date.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. The next question is, can you talk more to the upcoming Tesla Energy products and how your thinking has evolved on the revenue model? Given Tesla’s AI capabilities, how do you see the long-term mix between hardware margin and recurring software margin from Autobidder as this segment accelerates?
Unidentified Company Representative: We can’t comment on future product road map, but I can provide a quick energy Q2 update. Megapack continues to show strong demand globally with Lathrop ramping successfully to meet our contracted projects in 2023. As stated last quarter, Megapack margins are in a reasonable place, in line with our target – vehicle target margins. The second final assembly line at Lathrop is progressing on schedule, eventually doubling Lathrop capacity ahead of our full factory ramp in 2024. We have several exciting large projects in construction or nearing completion, including the KES project in Hawaii, the Riverina project in Australia, several products in California and one here at Gigafactory, Texas that we’ll tour today, actually. We want to thank our customers, utilities and grid operators for trusting us with these projects. On the Autobidder question, we continue to grow Autobidder contracts in wholesale markets like Australia, Texas, UK and California with over 6 gigawatt hours under Tesla’s dispatch next year. In the UK, our projects performed best in the industry in Q2. Autobidder does have software margins and is an enabler for hardware sales, but it’s a relatively small contributor to revenues, given how much deployment growth on the Megapack hardware side is occurring. It’s important to remember that these large projects – these large capital projects have lifetimes of 20 years of recurring revenues on an annualized basis relative to upfront CapEx are small. On the residential side, we have some fun things happening. We recently surpassed 0.5 million Powerwalls installed. Just this week, we are launching Charge on Solar, which allows Tesla Powerwall and vehicle customers to charge their vehicles using their excess solar and drive only on the sunshine that hits their roof. Yesterday, we began paying customers in Texas for participating in our virtual power plant to provide grid support to ERCOT. We expect these credits to lower our median customer’s annual bill by a third and to increase these credits over time as ERCOT expands market access. And today, we are expanding Tesla electric enrollment to new Model 3 owners in Texas, followed by all Texas vehicle customers over the rest of the quarter. Unfortunately and somewhat similar to Tesla Insurance, bringing Tesla electric and BPP capabilities to our customers requires working through a fractured regulatory environment on a jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis. In the long run, the value of residential energy software and hardware will be driven by the level of market access that utilities, market operators and regulators permit. For Powerwall that’s eligible to provide the full stack of energy services, like peaker capacity and system buffering, such as in Australia, we can more than double the value of ownership relative to a typical system today.
Martin Viecha: Thank you very much. The next question is, could you quantify the benefits to COGS per unit from the IRA battery manufacturing incentives; and secondly, battery raw material declines year-to-date?
Zachary Kirkhorn: All right. I can take that. On the first part of the question for IRA manufacturing incentives, we provided previous guidance that we expect these to be for the course of this year in the range of $150 million to $250 million per quarter. We are staying within that boundary as we guided previously, so that was the case in Q2 as well. I will note, and I think we’ve mentioned this before, that this includes a 50-50 sharing of credits for qualified cells from our long-term battery partner, Panasonic. On the commodity side, we are continuing to see improvements there, as we’ve discussed previously. Lithium is the most notable improvement so far. I think I commented on this on the last call, because typically, we see this coming about a quarter before it actually is realized in our financials. And also just as a reminder, we’re not fully exposed to the price of lithium. Our supply chain team has done a terrific job in partnership with another – a bunch of other companies to put in place some long-term agreements here, but we do have some exposure that moves up and down. We’re also seeing benefits in aluminum and steel, which I think is great. Not as large as the lithium impacts, but they contribute nonetheless. So, if we add up the total impact of this in Q2 relative to prior quarter, it’s about the same size and magnitude as the IRA benefits that we also received. Just to put this in context, as you look at COGS per unit sequentially from Q1 to Q2, I think there’s two things to keep in mind there. The first is that our SX mix for deliveries increased quite a bit from Q1 to Q2. So, as you think about fundamental cost reductions, it’s important to adjust for that. And then secondly, as we continue to work on reducing our Austin and Berlin cost, which we did quite a bit of that from Q1 to Q2, these factories are still slightly above Model Y production costs elsewhere. And in the quarter, our mix of Austin and Berlin related builds increased. And so, that’s something to consider as you model out the impact on – from Q1 to Q2 in terms of COGS per unit. I do want to ask Karn if there’s anything else on the commodity side or just more generally, you want to add here?
Karn Budhiraj: Yes. As you mentioned, Zach, we’ve naturally been a little bit hedged from the lithium position because of the long-term contracts we have in place. But we have seen reduction in pricing across the board for all commodities that specifically go into batteries such as nickel, cobalt and graphite. And the reductions in pricing translate into thousands of dollars when you look at it from a per-vehicle impact. We’re taking advantage of the historically low commodity pricing and certainly [Indiscernible] to kind of extend some of those fixed price contracts through the end of the decade. So it’s a playbook that we’ll continue to kind of go back to as we look to the future.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question on FSD. Have you considered allowing FSD transferability as a lever to allow existing customers to upgrade to a new Tesla instead of being locked into an existing car due to the price of FSD?
Elon Musk: Yes. This is a question we get asked a lot. So, we’re excited to announce that for Q3, we will be allowing transfer of FSD. This is a onetime amnesty. So, it needs to be -- you need to take advantage of it in Q3, but -- or at least place the order in Q3 within reasonable delivery time frames. So yes, I hope this makes people happy. This is a onetime thing.
Martin Viecha: Right. The next question, when will we give more information about the Cybertruck orders, estimated delivery schedules, pricing and specifications?
Elon Musk: Demand is so far off the hook, you can’t even see the hook. So, that’s really not an issue. I do want to emphasize that the Cybertruck has a lot of new technology in it, like a lot. It doesn’t look like -- it doesn’t look like any other vehicle because it is not like any other vehicle. So -- and the production ramp will move as fast as the slowest and least likely elements of the entire supply chain and internal production. So, I wouldn’t expect -- I hope it’s smooth. We’re certainly better at production ramps that -- we’ve got a lot of experience with the production ramps. But first order approximation, there’s like 10,000 unique parts and processes in the Cybertruck. And if any one of -- it will go as fast as the least lucky, least well-executed element of the 10,000. So, it’s always difficult to predict the ramp initially, but I think we’ll be making them in high volume next year, and we will be delivering the car this year.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is critics of Gigacasting contended that process makes vehicles harder and more costly to repair, essentially pushing costs on to the customer. Can you share some details about the initial repair experience with Gigacast vehicles?
Elon Musk: That must be why everyone’s copying us.
Lars Moravy: Thanks, Elon. This is Lars. I mean, that’s like simply not true. There’s a misconception that traditional bodies are easy to repair, but they are made up of multiple materials and multiple joining methods. Spot welds and rivets have to be drilled out. Panels and structural adhesives have to be chiseled out. Dried adhesive has to be removed, stains, cut, blah, blah, blah.
Elon Musk: It’s a crazy patch of a quilt.
Lars Moravy: Yes. And so putting that back together means time and money. Using an example of replacing a rear cast rail in the Model Y, to do that versus like what we replaced it with from Model 3, it’s 10 times cheaper and 3 times faster to do it with the cast rail. Design team works with our collision repair team since we’re a closed loop on this with insurance, and we design specific parts that make it easier and faster to repair. And we have an incentive to do that because we have our own insurance and our own body shops. We expect that we’ll continue to do this, and collision repair will continue to become cheaper and faster over time. And we already make this available to all body shops or our Tesla-approved body shop training.
Elon Musk: Yes, closing loop on collision repair and factoring that into design is a big deal.
Lars Moravy: Crucial. I don’t think anyone else can do it with that ecosystem that we have, so.
Elon Musk: Yes. And we are actually able to change the details of the casting with inserts, and we actually do that all the time, so -- because the inserts actually wear out and need to be replaced anyway. So we can actually make design changes to the inserts and tweak the castings. But the cast --basically cast rear body or front body is lighter, cheaper, better noise vibration, harshness, much easier to manufacture. It’s better in every way. And that’s why so many other car companies are copying us.
Lars Moravy: Probably.
Elon Musk: Well, they certainly put out a lot of press releases about it. I think it’s basically going to be how all cars are made in the future.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Next question, how many Optimus bots have been made? And when will they be able to start performing useful tasks?
Elon Musk: 10 million. Yes. I think we’re around 5 or 6 bots. I think -- there’s -- we were -- look, 10, I guess. Depends on what -- how many are working and what phase. But it’s sort of -- yes, there’s more every month. There’s a lot of interesting things about the Optimus bot. We found that there are actually no suppliers that can produce the actuators. There are no off-the-shelf actuators that work well for humanoid robot at any price.
Unidentified Company Representative: Certainly not compelling.
Elon Musk: Yes. There’s not a humanoid robot that can do something -- the things that human could do. So, we’ve actually had to design our own actuators that integrate the motor or the power electronics, the controller, the sensors. And really, every one of them is custom designed. And then, of course, we’ll be using the same inference hardware as the car. But we are, in designing these actuators, designing them for volume production. So, they’re not just lighter, tighter and more capable than any other actuators wherever that exists in the world, but it’s also actually manufacturable. So, we should be able to make them in volume. The first Optimus that is -- that will have all of the Tesla designed actuators, sort of production candidate actuators integrated and walking should be around November-ish. And then, we’ll start ramping up after that. In terms of when we’ll be able to do some useful things, like we’ll first be trying this out in our own factories and just proving out its utility, but I think we’ll be able to have it do something useful in our factories sometime next year. I would be -- yes, I’m pretty confident of that. So yes, it’s going well. I should say another cool thing about Optimus is that there’s -- just in the U.S. alone, there are 2 million amputees. And I was just talking to the Neuralink team. And by combining a Neuralink implant and a robotic arm or leg for someone that has had their arm or leg or arms and legs amputated, we believe we can give basically a cyber body that is incredibly capable, $6 million man in real life, before don’t want to cost $6 million. $60,000 man. This sounds impressive, but it will actually -- so that actually could be a really -- I think, would be incredible to potentially help people around the world and give them a robot arm or like that is as good, maybe long term better than a biological one.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, how has the order intake trended relatively to production levels during Q2? And how has it trended in the quarter-to-date period? Conceptually, how does Tesla decide when is it appropriate to reduce prices or at other sales incentives to increase demand?
Elon Musk: Yes. I guess, demand has roughly tracked production. So -- which is what we aim for is -- we look at -- it’s something that we have that really -- I think no other carmaker has -- is that we have real-time demand and real-time production, like so seven days a week. I get an e-mail -- order generated e-mail, chose output from all factories and orders globally. So it’s like a real-time finger on the pulse of earth basically. And we adjust course according to what the mood of the public is. Buying a new car is a big decision for vast majority of people. So, any time there’s economic uncertainty, people generally pause on new car buying at least to see what happens. And then obviously, another challenge is the interest rate environment. As interest rates rise, the affordability of anything bought with debt decreases, so effectively increasing the price of the car. So when interest rates rise dramatically, we actually have to reduce the price of the car because the interest payments increase the price of the car. And this is -- at least up until recently, it was, I believe, the sharpest interest rate rise in history. So, we had to do something about that. If somebody’s got a crystal ball for the global economy, I really appreciate it, if I could borrow that crystal ball.
Unidentified Company Representative: DM us.
Elon Musk: Yes, exactly, DM me. It should be not on Twitter. So, I mean, one day, it seems like the world economy is falling apart and the next day, everything is fine. I don’t know what’s going on. It’d be totally fine. I wish I did. So, I mean that’s why I say like I was on Twitter, I posted like just really advising because I care a lot about the sort of small shareholders, especially ones that have stuck with us through thick and thin. I love you, guys. And so, we can’t control these macro shocks or the thematic depressive nature of the stock market. So, that’s why I recommend against margin loans in times that are turbulent. If times are not that turbulent, actually margin loan can be a smart move within reason. But we’re in, I would call it, turbulent times. Like I have very high confidence in the long-term value of Tesla. Like I see it -- I really see a path to a 10x -- call it a 5x increase in the value of the company, maybe a 10x. And -- but where things go along the way, the trials and tribulations and the mood of the markets, one cannot predict. And so, the old adage of buy and hold is right. For an investment advice, I’d say like identifying a company as products you love. See if they -- does it seem like they’ll continue to make good products or great products? Buy that stock and hold it. That’s it. You’ll win. The reason companies exist is to make goods and services, ideally great goods and services. They don’t exist for any other reason. They shouldn’t. So, that’s why you should buy stock of a company that makes good products and has a great future pipeline. It’s common sense, actually. And then generally, if you see -- if you provide your confidence about what that company’s products or services are, when the market panics, buy; and when the market is overly exuberant, you can sell. I’m not recommending you to Tesla, but yes, buy low, sell high. Warren Buffett actually, I think has a saying -- I’m paraphrasing him, but a publicly traded company is like imagine living in your house and some crazy manic-depressive guy comes and stands outside your house and yells property prices at you, and it’s a different price every day. But the house is still the same house. So, this is a stock market. Credit that to Warren Buffett.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let’s go to the next question. With the emphasis of price cuts to drive volume growth eating into automotive gross margin, can investors expect to see automotive gross margin stabilize or even rise due to efficiencies outpacing the cuts? And if so, when?
Elon Musk: Where’s that crystal ball, again? If I may, look, the short-term variances in gross margin and profitability really are minor relative to the long-term picture. Autonomy will make all of these numbers look silly. I’d recommend looking at ARK Invest. I think their analysis is very good. It’s the best. And generally, Fintwit or the finance, Smart Finance people on Twitter, follow their accounts. They’re great. So that’s in my opinion where you’ll get the best info. So, I strongly believe Tesla is a big long-term investment. And don’t sweat when things go up and down. In fact, if the market panics, buy; if the market is a little too exuberant, sell at the time. But just generally, like -- I feel -- I’m confident we’ll deliver over long term, but can’t control short term. So -- and the autonomy is really where it’s at. I mean, Zachary?
Zachary Kirkhorn: I fully agree with you. I mean, I think the only thing in the short term that matters is what I said in my opening remarks, which is are we generating enough money to continue to invest. And the portfolio of products and technologies that the technical teams are investing in right now, this is intense. It’s intense in terms of investment; it’s intense in terms of potential.
Elon Musk: Frankly, I think it’s ridiculous that we have positive free cash flow in a capital-intensive business, while investing massive amounts of money in new technology. That is super hard.
Unidentified Company Representative: And vertical integration. It’s not even just like new products, but also...
Elon Musk: Yes. We actually make our share...
Zachary Kirkhorn: And so, at least from my perspective, what matters is continuing to generate the cash to invest. That means continuing to be hyper focused on near-term cost reduction. Is everything we do in near-term cost reduction provides capital to reinvest? Hyper-focused on working capital management, which we’ve made quite a bit of progress there on the raw materials and with -- a set of that we’ve been very focused on accounts receivables as well to ensure that we can continue to reinvest the cash. This is what we’re focused on. And so, there’s a set of this that we control. We have a pipeline of cost reductions. We are getting tailwinds in the commodity space right now, as Karn mentioned, that’s helpful. Variability around average selling prices goes back to Elon’s point. We don’t control interest rates. We don’t control macro consumer sentiment. But we have an obligation to be responsive to that to ensure that we’re matching supply and demand and keeping things balanced. And so, this is how we’re managing the next handful of quarters. Soon enough, these quarters will be behind us. They won’t be part of the present value of future cash flows of the business. And so, we want to make sure we keep that view and make sure that the long term business is exactly the way that we want it to be.
Martin Viecha: All right. Thank you very much. Now let’s go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays.
Dan Levy: I wanted to start first with a question about your efforts in AI and Dojo. It’s pretty clear it sounds like you’re accelerating your focus. Can you maybe provide us with a sense of what the process is of refining a product? Is it more machines? And maybe you could give us a sense of when the payout starts to -- when you start to see the payout and what the resource outlay is, what should we expect on the OpEx front as a result of this?
Elon Musk: Sorry. Are you saying how much are we going to spend on Dojo or…?
Dan Levy: Yes.
Elon Musk: R&D on Dojo?
Dan Levy: Yes.
Elon Musk: Well, we’re not going to be open loop on our Dojo expenditures. So -- but I mean, I think we will be spending something north of $1 billion over the next year on -- through the next year, it’s well over $1 billion in Dojo. And yes, so I mean we’ve got a truly staggering amount of video data to do training on. And this is another thing -- in order to copy us, you also need to spend billions of dollars on training compute. I mean, it’s like -- and it’s also hard to -- you need the data and you need the training computer. It’s like -- think, well, things needed to actually achieve this at scale toward generalized solution for autonomy, it’s -- this is one of the highest problems ever. You see a lot of AI companies doing LLMs and whatnot. I would say if they’re so great, why can’t they make a self-driving car? Because it’s harder. That’s why. So -- but I do think -- I think there’s some great AI companies out there. But just fundamentally, the staggering amount of data we’ve got to process, it’s got to be processed somehow. And custom silicon is the best way to do that. So that’s what Dojo is designed to do is optimize for video training. It’s not optimized for LLMs. It’s optimized for video training. With video training, you have a much higher ratio of compute-to-memory bandwidth, so -- whereas LLMs tends to be memory bandwidth choked. So that’s it. I mean -- but like I said, we’re also -- we have some -- we’re using a lot of NVIDIA hardware. We’ll continue to -- we’ll actually take NVIDIA hardware as fast as NVIDIA will deliver it to us. Tremendous respect for Jensen and NVIDIA. They’ve done an incredible job. And frankly, I don’t know if they could deliver us enough GPUs, we might not need Dojo, but they can’t. So they’ve got so many customers. They’ve been kind enough to nonetheless, prioritize some of our GPU orders. But yes, the sheer magnitude of video training -- because like I said, we’re not trying to just get as good as human. We want to get to 10 times better than human, maybe 100 times better than human. Right now, I believe there’s something on the order of 1 million automotive deaths per year. And then if you say permanent serious injuries, I think it’s probably closer to 10 million per year. And -- so it matters if you’re twice as good as human, 10 times -- like 10 times better than human would still mean 100,000 deaths and 1 million severe permanent injuries. So, it’s like, okay, we would rather be 100 times better. So there’s really -- it’s a march of 9s, and we want to achieve as perfect safety as possible. And that’s truly mind-boggling amounts of video and computer needed for that. And then, I do think there’s other applications for Dojo, but we just desperately need it for video training.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Just to add to what Elon mentioned. So, the numbers that he mentioned are between R&D spend and capital spend. And this is moving quickly. And so, we provide a three-year outlook on our capital expense. We are considering these expenses in that outlook. And as that moves up and down, we’ll continue to update our guidance in the Q.
Elon Musk: Yes. I want to say, the fundamental rate limiter on the progress of full self-driving is training. That’s -- if we had more training compute, we would get it done faster. So that’s it.
Zachary Kirkhorn: And it’s just difficult to predict how quickly we can execute on it.
Dan Levy: Great. Thank you. Just as a follow-up, I recognize there’s incredible macro uncertainty right now, but you’re sticking with your near term, your volume target of 50% CAGR. As we just think about sort of in the year ahead, Cybertruck is going to be some contribution. There’s going to be some help from further EV penetration growth. But to what extent are you willing to sacrifice on pricing to keep that 50% volume CAGR intact, or are you thinking differently about margins versus your prior commentary of willing to sacrifice on margins to get more share?
Elon Musk: It’s not about getting more share. It’s just that you can think of every car that we sell or produce that has full autonomy capability as actually something that in the future may be worth as much as 5 times what it is today. Because average -- vehicle is doing like maybe 10 hours of driving a week. If sort of -- if this says 1.5 hours a day on average, that’s 10 hours a week-ish. If you’ve got on autonomous -- if the vehicle is able to operate autonomously and use either dedicated autonomous or partially autonomous like Airbnb, like maybe sometimes you allow your car to be used by others. Sometimes you want to use it exclusively just like Airbnb -- doing Airbnb with a room in your house. The value is just tremendous. So, I think it’s sort of, it would be -- I think it -- it does make sense to sacrifice margins in favor of making more vehicles because we think in the not too distant future, they will have a dramatic valuation increase. I think the Tesla fleet value increase at the point which we can upload full self-driving and is approved by regulators will be the single biggest step change in asset value maybe in history.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let’s go to the next analyst. The question comes from Emmanuel Rosner from Deutsche Bank.
Emmanuel Rosner: Two questions from me as well. First, following up on the autonomy. So before you start launching these dedicated robotaxi vehicles, on existing vehicles, you’re improving FSD incrementally. What is your latest targeted timing to essentially release a non-beta version or an eyes-off version that would trigger much higher take rates? And would Tesla benefit from lowering the price of FSD?
Elon Musk: Well, obviously, as people have sort of made fun of me and perhaps quite fairly have made fun of me, my predictions about achieving full self-driving have been optimistic in the past. The reason I’ve been optimistic is -- it tends to look like is the -- we’ll make rapid progress with a new version of FSD, but then it will curve over logarithmically. So first, logarithmic curve looks like just sort of fairly straight upward line, diagonally up. And so, if you extrapolate that, then you have a great thing. But then because it’s actually logarithmic, it curves over, and then there have been a series of stacked logarithmic curves. Now, I’m the boy who cried FSD, but I think we’ll be better than human by the end of this year. That’s not to say we’re approved by regulators. And I’m saying that would be in the U.S. because we’ve got to focus on one market first. But I think we’ll be better than human by the end of this year. I’ve been wrong in the past, I may be wrong this time. And the price of FSD -- so the great thing is the price of FSD is actually very low, it’s not high. When you go back to what I said earlier, the value of the car increases dramatically if it is actually autonomous. $15,000 is actually a low price, not a high price. And we will offer -- and we -- I think we do sort of offer FSD as a sort of monthly subscription, although most people don’t know that. So, I’d recommend like maybe trying it out as a monthly subscription so you don’t have to go with the $15,000 thing. But I think yes, yes -- obviously, if the car is worth several times its original price, $15,000 is actually a low price for FSD.
Martin Viecha: And the next question comes from William Stein from Truist.
William Stein: I’d like to ask about -- to stick on this AI topic. We’ve read with great interest the developments in Dojo today, and you’ve spoken about FSD, but you’ve also -- Elon, you started this x.ai company. And for investors that think that there might be quite a bit of value in the AI features and products of Tesla, it might be concerning to see you pursuing another endeavor where AI is the focus. So can you talk about how x.ai might overlap, might perhaps compete with Tesla or in other ways, perhaps it enhances the value of what Tesla does?
Elon Musk: Yes. I think it’ll actually enhance the value of Tesla. There were just some of the world’s best AI engineers and scientists that were willing to join a startup, but they were not willing to join a large sort of relatively established company like Tesla. So, it was like -- that’s actually how it got started. I was interviewing a few people and they’re like, no, we want to do a startup. I was like, and that’s well -- I couldn’t convince them to join Tesla. So -- so it’s like, okay, well, better to start up that I run than go work somewhere else. That’s kind of the genesis of xAI. And xAI is focused on sort of AGI. Yes. So it’s -- like I said, I think there will be some value that xAI brings to Tesla. Also some of the best -- for the very best people in the world, they really just want to work on interesting problem. So if you take, say, a material science group, really what convinced Charlie Colman to leave Apple, where he was very happy and well compensated, and both at -- in both -- where we think is the best material science group in the world, was that he got to work at both Tesla and SpaceX. He wasn’t willing to leave Apple if it was just Tesla, but he’s willing to do it if it is Tesla and SpaceX. So sometimes you get the best talent in the world if that’s the kind of thing you need to do. And that actually has been very beneficial to Tesla.
William Stein: If I could squeeze one more mundane question in. I wonder if you think you can hit the 1.8 million unit number with current pricing, or do you anticipate needing to continue to lower prices because it seems like they’ve stabilized. The trends have stabilized in the last maybe 1.5 months. Should we expect sort of continued decreases or more stabilization for the rest of the year?
Elon Musk: Sure. We have sort of -- we started the referral program, which I think will be quite effective. As Zach was saying earlier, we don’t control the macroeconomic conditions. So, if interest rates continue to rise, that reduces the affordability of cars. And for a lot of people, they’re really -- they’re just really breaking even every month. In fact, if you look at the rise in credit card debt, they are, in fact, not breaking even every month. Credit card debt is looking scary. So, we just don’t control the market conditions. If market condition is stable, I think prices will be stable. If they’re not stable, then we would have lower prices. Yes.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let’s go to Colin Rusch from Oppenheimer.
Colin Rusch: As you’re building out Dojo and implementing what truly is going to be a highly complex set of software, can you speak to the maturity of the operating system and how much outsourced software you’re expecting to use in that system?
Elon Musk: This is a custom software stack, so. But it is designed such that you can run at a high level, PyTorch and JAX. But then we have to customize it to actually run on a custom silicon. So, the software stack is a combination of open source software and then Tesla software all the way to the bare silicon, which is the case for the inference computer in the car.
Colin Rusch: Okay. Thanks so much. That’s super helpful. And then can you speak to how you’re managing some of the geopolitical risks relative to your capacity expansion? Obviously, as you guys continue to grow at this rate, you’re going to be putting some folks out of business. And there’s going to be some impacts around regional economy. So, I just want to understand how you’re thinking about that in terms of some of your CapEx plans and how you’re managing some of those relationships with different countries and regions.
Elon Musk: Well, this is a period of unusual geopolitical risk. So, I think we’re -- the best we can do is have factories in many parts of the world such that if things get difficult in one part of the world, we can still keep things going in the rest of the world.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question comes from Mark Delaney from Goldman Sachs.
Mark Delaney: Tesla has been making progress reducing costs and did so again last quarter. Can you give an update on when you think automotive COGS per vehicle could be under the historical $36,000 per vehicle level? And what are the key puts and takes to get there?
Zachary Kirkhorn: This is -- I think I was asked this in the past. This is very difficult to forecast. There’s a series of costs that we manage, the series of costs which we don’t control. And so particularly on the commodity side, where labor costs go, et cetera, it’s just hard to say.
Elon Musk: Yes. And we saw very inflationary -- like strong inflationary pressures for a while last year. And now -- which obviously makes it very difficult to reduce COGS. And now we’re seeing what seems to be deflationary pressures, certainly deflationary -- deflation isn’t pressure. But we’re seeing commodity prices dropping as was mentioned, as Karn mentioned a moment ago. I mean, I don’t know, what do you think? I mean, basically, the trends seem to be deflationary at the commodity level.
Karn Budhiraj: Definitely. There’s that. And then there’s also the unit economics improve as volumes grow. That’s the other thing we’re seeing. As we’re becoming a bigger and better part of a lot of suppliers, the economies of scale come into play. There’s equipment depreciation that comes into play, equipment that was commissioned 5 to 7 years ago. That used to be a part of the piece price. That’s completely amortized. So, we’ll see situation where piece price comes down because that equipment contribution has gone away. And then just we continue to have this mentality of continuous improvement in terms of labor, reducing labor, improving automation, and just continue to get better at what we do. So we have seen -- I think every quarter, we have seen an improvement. Of course, the commodities spiked up and down. Just in general, the trend is towards being more efficient.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes, I’m totally agreeing.
Elon Musk: Yes, lithium prices were absolutely insane there for a while.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. And they’re recovering now.
Karn Budhiraj: Cobalt -- the way it used to be.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. And we’re still early in the ramp -- well, not early in the ramp, but early in the cost down curve of Austin and Berlin. And so, it takes time to work the cost out it. First, it’s a focus on ramp -- ramp, it brings cost down...
Elon Musk: And quality costs…
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. And then once that stabilizes, we can divert bandwidth to cost reduction. And so Austin and Berlin saw quite a decent amount of cost reduction on a fundamental basis from Q1 to Q2. We’ll continue to do that work that will be helpful. And so we’re just going to keep chipping away at it.
Unidentified Company Representative: Packaging is a big element to that.
Elon Musk: Yes, logistics…
Zachary Kirkhorn: Logistics is normalizing, which is great.
Unidentified Company Representative: [Indiscernible] utilization, something that the team has been very focused on. So, every bit of it.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes, and it’s hard...
Elon Musk: Logistics is underappreciated. Yes, so sold saying goes like valves and with tactics as one with logistics.
Unidentified Company Representative: Yes. And we’ve made tremendous improvements in cost in all fronts on expired costs. We have done pre-pandemic expired cost levels now, and our goal is to go further down.
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. So when we look at our progress from Q1 to Q2 on cost, the way that we look at internally, normalized for the impacts of mix shift with Austin and Berlin being a higher percentage of our mix, normalized for S and X being a higher percentage of our mix in Q2 versus Q1, the sequential cost reduction, it might be the largest we’ve had in a while. So, I think it’s great work on behalf of the Tesla team, and we just got to keep it up.
Elon Musk: Yes, it’s a game of pennies. It’s a Game of Thrones with pennies.
Martin Viecha: Mark, do you have a follow-up question? I think you’re muted.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Thank you very much for all the details on that. Maybe you could put a finer point on the downtime impact that you spoke about in your prepared comments in terms of production impact and then also to what extent there’s a margin impact from those factory upgrades that you’re planning this quarter?
Zachary Kirkhorn: Yes. The downtime -- we don’t know exactly the number of cars impacted because kind of the way that we go into downtime windows for upgrades is we set aside a period of time, but then the team is challenged to go as quickly as possible so that we can get the factories up and running again and minimize that. It’s not profound reduction. Hopefully, it’s small.
Elon Musk: I think we’re getting too much into the weeds here. I mean, like we’re asking for a level of precision that is not possible to answer. So, let’s move on.
Martin Viecha: Yes. I think this is unfortunately all the time we have for today. So, we’ll speak to you all in the next three months. Thank you very much.
Elon Musk: Thank you."
5724,ON,3,2023,2023-10-30 12:00:27,"Operator: Welcome to the onsemi Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised, today's conference is being recorded.  I would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Parag Agarwal, Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Please go ahead. 
Parag Agarwal : Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and thank you for joining onsemi's Third Quarter 2023 Quarterly Results Conference Call. I'm joined today by Hassane El-Khoury, our President and CEO; and Thad Trent, our CFO.  This call is being webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.onsemi.com. A replay of this webcast, along with our 2023 third quarter earnings release, will be available on our website approximately 1 hour following this conference call, and the recorded webcast will be available for approximately 30 days following this conference call. Additional information is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website.  Our earnings release and this presentation include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and a discussion of certain limitations when using non-GAAP financial measures are included in our earnings release, which is posted separately on our website in the Investor Relations section. During the course of this conference call, we will make projections or other forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. We wish to caution that such statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from projections. Important factors that can affect our business, including factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from our forward-looking statements, are described in our most recent Form 10-K, Form 10-Qs, our other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in our earnings release for the third quarter of 2023. Our estimates for other forward-looking statements will change, and the company assumes no obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect actual results, change assumptions or other events that may occur except as required by law.  Now let me turn it over to Hassane. Hassane? 
Hassane El-Khoury: Thank you, Parag. Good morning, and thanks to everyone on the call for joining us. This morning, we are pleased to announce another quarter where we delivered revenue of $2.18 billion, non-GAAP gross margin of 47.3% and non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.39, all exceeding the midpoint of our guidance. Our Automotive and Industrial segments achieved record revenue, driven by demand in both silicon and silicon carbide.  Despite these results in the third quarter, we are taking a very cautious approach as we are starting to see pockets of softness with Tier 1 customers in Europe working through their inventory and increasing risk to automotive demand due to high interest rates. It has been nearly three years since the start of our transformation, and our worldwide employees have been relentless in their pursuit of operational excellence. The structural changes we have made across the company have allowed us to maintain our performance and deliver predictable financials. We have built the resilience required in our business to navigate a dynamic macro environment, and we remain focused on controlling what we can: Our execution and our commitment to our customers.  And silicon carbide has been a prime example of our execution. Our factories in Hudson, Roznov and Bucheon all had record output for silicon carbide in Q3. Acquiring GTAT two years ago was a strategic investment that allowed us to produce our own substrates internally and accelerate our path to becoming the world leader in silicon carbide power devices. By the end of 2023, we expect to have more than 25% market share of the silicon carbide market. We are now producing more than 50% of our own substrates internally, one quarter ahead of schedule, and we plan to continue to do so through 2024 even as we transition furnaces for 200-millimeter production.  In fact, last week, we announced that we completed our expansion of the world's largest silicon carbide fab in Bucheon. At full capacity, the state-of-the-art facility will be able to manufacture more than 1 million 200-millimeter silicon carbide wafers per year. Our manufacturing output continues to exceed expectations, and the acceleration of our ramp resulted in achieving a $1 billion run rate quarter in Q3, increasing nearly 50% over Q2.  However, for the full year, a single automotive OEM's recent reduction in demand will impact our $1 billion target, and we now expect to ship more than $800 million of silicon carbide in 2023, 4x last year's revenue. In '24, we expect the growth of our silicon carbide business to double the market growth.  Over the past few quarters, we have accelerated the broad deployment of silicon carbide solutions, and the design activity has been robust across all regions. So far in 2023, we have shipped to more than 500 unique customers that will continue to ramp through 2024, further expanding our geographical customer distribution. Additionally, we have design wins and/or LTSAs with the leading automotive players who have over 50% share of the global EV unit sales, which includes LTSAs with 4 of the top 5 China EV customers. NIO is among them. And in Q3, they made onsemi their prevailing silicon carbide supplier by signing an extension to their multiyear long-term supply agreement, doubling down on 1,200-volt EliteSiC technology as they transition into 800-volt battery solutions through 2030.  As we navigate the current market conditions, LTSAs continue to provide demand visibility and stability in pricing. EV traction remains the fastest-growing part of our SiC business, with 70% growth sequentially. Most recently, an OEM awarded onsemi a platform for their 750-volt and 1,200-volt EV traction inverters previously awarded to an incumbent. Opting for superior technology and a vertically integrated supply chain, this leading OEM has now signed an LTSA with onsemi through 2031, putting us in a position to support higher volume production.  Energy infrastructure remained healthy in Q3, driven by the continued adoption of solar and energy storage solutions. We remain on track to our full year projections with nearly 70% revenue growth over 2022, and we expect the growth to continue in '24 as demand for our hybrid modules with silicon and silicon carbide solutions for this high-growth industrial megatrend remains strong.  Our medical revenue, which is reported within our industrial end market, also remains healthy, driven by the improved accessibility of continuous glucose monitoring and hearing aids. We have deep, long-standing customer engagements and high-margin, high-growth areas of continuous glucose monitors in hearing health, where we have leading market share with our technologies. Our CGM business increased nearly 38% quarter-over-quarter, driven by a ramp from the top 2 leaders in the market.  onsemi is #1 in image -- in automotive image sensors and #1 in industrial scanning. In the industrial end market, our design activity has already surpassed all of 2022. This is a good indicator for the business, given that more than 40% of our image sensing revenue comes from new products. Last month, we introduced another 8-megapixel image sensor with the world's smallest, lowest power family of Hyperlux products that can extend battery life by up to 40% for industrial and commercial cameras. In fact, our 8-megapixel revenue more than doubled year-over-year in the third quarter as the business is shifting to higher resolution, higher ASP image sensors.  And now let me turn the call over to Thad to give you more details on our results. 
Thad Trent : Thanks, Hassane. At the start of our transformation, we committed to delivering intelligent power and sensing technologies for the sustainable ecosystem. This meant tailoring our investments, our portfolio, our manufacturing footprint and our resources to focus on the high-growth megatrends in automotive and industrial, such as electric vehicles, ADAS and energy infrastructure. This has become our winning formula, allowing us to deliver the greatest value for all our stakeholders. Combined, intelligent power and intelligent sensing now account for 72% of our business, as compared to 68% in the quarter a year ago.  In the third quarter, our financial results exceeded the midpoint of our guidance, demonstrating the resilience in our business in a challenging market environment. Revenue of $2.18 billion increased 4% sequentially, and non-GAAP operating margin was 32.6%. Revenue from intelligent power and intelligent sensing combined increased 5% year-over-year. As for the end markets they serve, we had another quarter of record automotive revenue with nearly $1.2 billion in Q3, increasing 9% sequentially and 33% year-over-year, driven by silicon as well as silicon carbide as the need for electrification and advanced features and vehicles continues to rise.  In industrial, our record revenue of $616 million increased 1% sequentially and was up slightly year-over-year with continued strength in energy, infrastructure and medical. The rest of our businesses decreased 4% sequentially and 42% year-over-year as we exited $46 million of noncore business, which was below our expectations and is highlighting the resiliency of this business and the value of our full portfolio delivers for these customers. As always, we'll continue to be opportunistic in these noncore markets where margins are favorable and engagements are strategic with our customers.  Looking at the split between operating units. Revenue for Power Solutions Group, or PSG, was $1.2 billion, an increase of 10% year-over-year, with more than 60% increase in auto and 50% increase in energy infrastructure. Revenue for the Advanced Solutions Group, or ASG, was $622 million, a 15% decline over Q3 '22, driven by deliberate exits and continued softness in noncore markets. Revenue for the Intelligent Sensing Group, or ISG, was $329 million, a 4% decrease year-over-year due to lower revenue in industrial applications. Our GAAP and non-GAAP gross margin of 47.3% was down 10 basis points sequentially and 200 basis points as compared to non-GAAP gross margin in Q3 '22, primarily due to headwinds from our East Fishkill fab and factory utilization, offset by strong manufacturing performance in silicon carbide.  Total utilization increased slightly to 72% as silicon carbide utilization improved, while silicon utilization trended lower as planned. For the next few quarters, we expect to proactively lower utilization to the mid- to high-60% range while maintaining our gross margin above mid-40%. This is a direct result of our fab-liter strategy of divesting 4 fabs in 2022, which is reducing our fixed cost footprint while we continue to consolidate operations in larger, more efficient fabs. As we move to our Fab Right strategy to optimize and drive efficiencies across our manufacturing network, we expect to generate incremental cost savings over the next few years. We continue to identify opportunities to drive operational efficiencies and remain committed to our long-term gross margin trajectory.  Turning to silicon carbide. As Hassane mentioned, our silicon carbide manufacturing output is exceeding our internal expectations. And thanks to the tremendous efforts of our team around the world, we have accelerated our gross and operating margin trajectory. Our Q3 gross margin for silicon carbide was greater than 40% with strong fall-through on a fully loaded basis, including all start-up costs. And as we previously highlighted, we expect our silicon carbide business to be at the corporate gross margin in Q4.  Further, the yield improvement learnings we're getting from our 150-millimeter wafer production ramp is increasing our confidence in our 200-millimeter capability and validating our strategy of driving cost savings through brownfield investments. This incredible execution and improved manufacturing output on 150 millimeters enables us to slow our capacity expansion and lower 2024 capital intensity from the high teens to the low teens percentage points ahead of our original plan and closing in on our long-term model.  Now let me give you some additional numbers for your models. GAAP operating expenses for the third quarter were $344 million as compared to $634 million in the third quarter of 2022. Non-GAAP operating expenses were $322 million as compared to $304 million in the quarter a year ago. The increase in operating expenses is attributable to a reserve against the receivable balance with a manufacturing partner.  GAAP operating margin for the quarter was 31.5%, and non-GAAP operating margin was 32.6%. Our GAAP tax rate was 16.4%, and our non-GAAP tax rate was 15.6%. GAAP earnings per diluted share for the third quarter was $1.29 as compared to $0.70 in the quarter a year ago. Non-GAAP earnings per diluted share was near the high end of our guidance at $1.39 as compared to $1.45 in Q3 of 2022. Our GAAP diluted share count was 451 million shares, and our non-GAAP diluted share count was 439 million shares.  In Q3, we returned 75% of our free cash flow through $100 million of share repurchases, and we remain committed to our long-term strategy of returning 50% of free cash flow to our shareholders.  Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents was $2.7 billion, and we had $1.1 billion undrawn on our revolver. Cash from operations was $567 million, and free cash flow was $134 million, or 6.1% of revenue. Capital expenditures during Q3 were $433 million, which equates to a capital intensity of 19.9%. As we indicated previously, we are directing a significant portion of our capital expenditures towards silicon carbide and enabling our 300-millimeter capabilities at EFK.  Accounts receivable of $958 million increased by $14 million, and DSO was 40 days, down 1 day from the second quarter. Inventory increased by $120 million sequentially, and days of inventory increased by 3 days to 166 days. This includes approximately 64 days of bridge inventory to support fab transitions and the silicon carbide ramp. Excluding these strategic builds, our base inventory declined 7 days quarter-over-quarter to 102 days.  We continue to proactively manage distribution inventory. Disti inventory declined $25 million sequentially with weeks of inventory at 6.9 weeks versus 7.7 in Q2. Total debt remained flat at $3.5 billion, and net leverage is 0.25x.  As we look forward, I'd like to highlight that onsemi today is a completely transformed company as compared to ON Semiconductor of the past. The structural changes in our business model have eliminated the historical volatility in the margins and earnings of the company. We remain fully committed to delivering strong operational and financial performance for our shareholders in all market conditions.  Now let me provide you the key elements of our non-GAAP guidance for the fourth quarter. A table detailing our GAAP and non-GAAP guidance was provided in the press release related to our third quarter results. Given the current macro environment, we are taking a cautious stance in our guidance. We anticipate Q4 revenue to be in the range of $1.95 billion to $2.05 billion. We expect a mid-single-digit decline in automotive given the softness in Europe that Hassane described, with greater sequential declines in industrial and other end markets.  We expect non-GAAP gross margin to be between 45.5% and 47.5%, primarily due to lower factory utilization and continued EFK headwind. Our Q4 non-GAAP gross margin includes share-based compensation of $4.3 million. We expect our non-GAAP operating expenses of $300 million to $315 million, including share-based compensation of $28.5 million. We anticipate our non-GAAP other income to be a net benefit of $4 million, with our interest income exceeding interest expense. This benefit is a result of the debt restructuring activities we completed over the last 2 years, reducing a historical drag on the P&L while effectively eliminating exposure to elevated rates going forward. We expect our non-GAAP tax rate to be in the range of 15.5% to 16.5% and our non-GAAP diluted share count for the fourth quarter is expected to be approximately 438 million shares. This results in non-GAAP earnings per share to be in the range of $1.13 to $1.27.  We expect capital expenditures of $425 million to $465 million in brownfield investments, primarily in silicon carbide and EFK. On a final note, given the market uncertainty, we are taking a cautious approach as we exit 2023 and plan for 2024. We are taking proactive actions to set ourselves up for success, and we remain focused on our execution. The structural changes we have brought to our business have already proven effective in these market conditions. We have been exiting volatile businesses, lowering utilization, managing channel inventory, controlling wafer starts, and we plan to continue to seek opportunities to improve our efficiencies as we navigate through the current market conditions.  With that, I'd like to turn the call back over to Kevin to open up for Q&A. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank. 
Ross Seymore : Hassane, I want to ask about two questions on the automotive side. The first one that you talked about Europe being weaker, burning inventory. Can you give a little bit more color? Is that just Europe? Are you worried at all about that spreading to other regions? And any more color? Is it just inventory? Is it true demand? Any details would be helpful. 
Hassane El-Khoury: Sure. So we see it in Europe. Obviously, there's a big concentration of -- I highlighted the Tier 1s, the big concentration of Tier 1s in Europe. But I think it's driven by end demand, coupled with -- we've always said there may be pockets of inventory that were being flat through normal demand. But having demand kind of start to soften because of the high interest rates is causing the inventory burn to last longer. So we have always said the LTSAs provide us a phone call. It sets us up very nicely to see it coming. So therefore, we're taking a very proactive measure on setting ourselves up to be able to allow customers to burn while we maintain our inventory levels, add their shelves, the disti and on our balance sheet as well. 
Ross Seymore : I guess as my follow-up also within automotive, but on the SiC side, specifically. You lowered the bar from $1 billion roughly to over $800 million. I think you mentioned 1 customer. I don't expect you to name that one customer, but again, is that inventory? Are you worried at all about any secular changes? Obviously, the EVs cost more on average than ICE vehicles. So some of the dynamics, I would assume, impacting Europe in general would impact the EV side. But any sort of change in your secular belief on the silicon carbide side? 
Hassane El-Khoury: No, no change on the secular trend for EVs. EVs are going to grow. They're going to grow for us in the fourth quarter as well. It's just not going to grow in the fourth quarter at the rate that we expected. And of course, we're all looking at the same headlines as far as EVs are concerned. I think EVs are a long-term growth opportunity, even with the backdrop of a lot of the headlines that we're seeing. Customer designs have not slowed down, conversions to EV platforms have not slowed down. I take this as a temporary -- while a lot of the macro stuff gets worked out, whether it's the interest rates, which you called it, the expenses associated with purchasing EVs to the cost -- to the energy cost. All of that is just -- taken -- having an impact, but we do not change our long-term view of the opportunity we have in EV. And like I said, we're still going to grow in Q4, just not at the rate. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Vivek Arya with BofA Securities. 
Vivek Arya : Hassane, can you help us with kind of the building blocks as we think about calendar '24, so silicon carbide, non-silicon carbide and the exits that you're planning from the noncore areas? I just want to understand, right, how -- what the puts and takes are for those 3 building blocks so we can plan our models accordingly? 
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. Silicon carbide is -- what we are looking at is silicon carbide in '24, basically growing about 2x the market. So it's still on track to the target that we've put out in Analyst Day of growing 2x the market, that we still have that visibility in '24.  On the silicon side, we see flat, slightly down. Again, depending on what you believe, the market. We are not planning nor are we looking at a first half of '24 recovery. As I said on the last quarter, we see '24 as kind of going sideways with growth in silicon carbide for us. As far as the exit, by the end of this year, whatever we didn't exit is going to stay with us as a business. So we are not going to see us talking about this, the exits on the legacy business any longer in 2024. I put that all into the silicon outlook that I put out there. 
Vivek Arya : I see. So if I put it all together and look at the growth in silicon carbide and sort of the flattish plus/minus in other areas, is it unreasonable to expect ON's overall sales to grow next year? And if they do grow next year, how do you kind of align the gross margin? Can gross margins kind of hang on to these Q4 levels? Or are there other utilization or other things planned that can take gross margins down? So both kind of conceptually, can sales grow even if it's modest? And then can gross margins kind of continue at these Q4-type levels? 
Thad Trent : Vivek, it's Thad. As you know, we guide one quarter at a time. I think given the macro uncertainty, we're not going to try and forecast 2024 at this point. We feel really good about our pipeline, our design pipeline and our LTSAs at this point. But I think it's too early to provide guidance on '24. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chris Danely with Citi. 
Chris Danely : So another question on silicon carbide. Can you tell us how much of the weakness in Q4 is silicon carbide versus, I guess, just regular semis? And then you say that you still expect silicon carbide to grow 2x the market in 2024. Has your silicon carbide, I guess, market expectations, have those moved downward over the last 3 months for '24? 
Hassane El-Khoury: No. So I would say majority of the weakness in Q4 is the silicon carbide, obviously. But the rest of the business is kind of exactly where we expected it at the end of the year. As far as the outlook in the silicon carbide market in general or the EV market in general, it really has not changed our outlook. Our investments that we have been putting and even the investments we announced in Bucheon are not investments for '23 or '24. Those are long-term investments. And that adds to the confidence we have in that market being a megatrend market for us, and that's what we're investing in to gain that leadership in that market as it evolves. So no change in the outlook and the strategy. 
Chris Danely : Great. And then for my follow-up, I know you're not commenting on next year, but I think you said your gross margin should hold mid-40s. So if we look at your peers that have started to see the downturn, they're generally forecasting like three quarters in a row of declining sales. If you guys do have Q1, Q2 revenue down sequentially like your peers that are feeling this, can you still hold gross margins in the mid-40s, would you have to lower utilization rates further? Or I guess would that depend on just how much is silicon carbide versus how much is semis? 
Thad Trent : Yes. So right now, we're looking at taking our utilization down to that -- over the next several quarters down into that mid- to high-60% range. And as I said, we still expect to be able to hold that 40% -- that mid-40% gross margin floor there. This is really a result of all the structural changes that we've made inside the company, reducing that manufacturing footprint and really now focused on Fab Right, where we're getting optimized cost out of our existing footprint. But look, we're being cautious for the next several quarters, we'll take that utilization down. But we do believe we can hold that floor of mid-40. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. 
Harsh Kumar : I guess it's been a while since you guys have seen a revenue decline on a sequential basis. There's a lot of things going on in the marketplace, the strike, the China economy, you talked about a European. I guess, Hassane, I'd be curious if you could give us a sense of magnitude. You don't have to give us numbers, obviously, but just some color on what are some of the bigger factors and what are some of the smaller factors? And I do have one more. 
Hassane El-Khoury: Sure. I mean at a high level, it's end demand, if you think about it, and end demand is driven by -- you can call it two things. One is the financial, which is the higher interest rates that have been with us, and now they're taking a toll on end demand. But also, in all honesty, the uncertainty, the macro uncertainty that as consumers, people are starting to feel. Between these two, we look at it and we look at the inventory levels across the board. We look at inventory levels internally that we have. And we've -- you've always seen us operating with a very proactive approach. So our decisions and our outlook is driven by that cautious outlook on what we can control, which is our execution. That talks about taking our utilization down because we don't want to bridge it by keep building inventory. You've seen us take down a lot more on the channel, which sets us up very nicely should that turn the other way. So all of these are proactive decisions that we have taken in the short term but set us up much better in the long run. 
Harsh Kumar : Got it. So it sounds like it's pretty broad. And then I did miss -- I think Ross asked earlier about silicon carbide. It was one customer-driven. I did miss that in the commentary. Could you just confirm if it's mostly one customer-driven? Are you seeing kind of broad-based weakness -- in answer to my earlier question, is that broad-based weakness also prevalent in EVs overall with other guys? And is this also tied to your European commentary, the EV side and the European other one, the same problem? 
Hassane El-Khoury: Look, I think from an automotive, I would say it's a broader stroke as far as the inventory comment I made specifically with Tier 1s in Europe. As far as the EV, yes, it is a single customer. I wouldn't say it is broad as far as in this immediate quarter. But we still expect it to grow in Q4. So it is not a -- I don't want to paint it as any decline or any issue in demand for EVs. EV demand is going to grow. It's going to grow in the fourth quarter, and it's going to grow in 2024. It just didn't grow as much as we expected it to. And that's demand-driven. Whether it's short-term demand or anything different, we'll have to wait until we get closer to '24. 
Thad Trent : Just to be clear. On the silicon carbide, the expectation of being over $800 million, the impact there is one customer. It’s the recent demand softness at one customer. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Gary Mobley with Wells Fargo Securities. 
Gary Mobley : Hassane, I want to pin you down on your market forecast for silicon carbide for next year to really get an insight into what your expectations are. I know you cited in your footnotes of your presentation today, a lot of Yole forecast, and Yole is forecasting roughly 43% growth in silicon carbide for next year. So are you expecting to grow your silicon carbide revenue 80% next year? Is that the proper read here? 
Hassane El-Khoury: Well, it depends on what the Yole is. But yes, we are expecting a 2x market. 
Gary Mobley : Okay. And with respect to distribution inventory, you've been running your distribution inventory below the long-term targets purposefully, I read here. What are the triggers and dashboard metrics that you're looking at before you start to take up that distribution inventory back up to a normal level? Is it just as simple as seeing better sell-through? 
Hassane El-Khoury: It's more -- yes, it's seeing sell-through in the mix that we are expecting. So we have -- look, there's no one KPI. Thad and I look at about 30 pages of KPIs that try to triangulate the health of the business and the sell-through because what we don't want is shipping into the distribution because we -- there's demand or there's backlog, but the sell-through happens at a different mix. So you end up with what we call sludge in the channel.  We've been managing this very, very tightly. We have a very robust process that gets us and has maintained very tight control over the distribution inventory. And like Thad said, last quarter, in Q3, we actually reduced the dollars and the weeks, putting ourselves up very nicely for a Q4 mix shift or even getting ready for 2024. So all of these KPIs are what lead us to making these decisions. So we're going to look at our metrics and make the decision as we see it. 
Thad Trent : Yes. I would add that we've been managing that inventory in the 7- to 8-week range for several quarters now. I think we're going to stay in that range just given the uncertainty until we see the strong sell-through. But we're cautiously optimistic on that as we think about it. But I think for the foreseeable future, you're going to see us in that 7- to 8-week, you're not going to see us bouncing back up to historical levels the company ran at several years ago. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Joshua Buchalter with TD Cowen. 
Joshua Buchalter : I wanted to follow up on one of Gary's. So I totally understand the near-term dynamic where your customer concentrated in ramping silicon carbide. But I'm a bit surprised to see the '24 guidance pegged to market growth, given I think the overwhelming consensus is that silicon carbide is going to be constrained for at least for the near term. Can you walk through how much, I guess, of your silicon carbide revenue in '24 is really program-specific? And how fungible supply is if there is changes in mix across your end customers? 
Hassane El-Khoury: Sure. So it is all -- I guess all of our '24 by now. For the '24, we have visibility on exactly what program, what voltage, what volume and what mix we need. As far as the inventory, Thad talks about ramping strategic inventory for silicon carbide, we stage inventory primarily in, I would say, in two spots. One is blank wafers or substrate, wafer substrate, which is fully fungible across any customer, any platform with any volume. And as we get closer, we stage inventory at Epi, which is when we, I guess, partitioned with the voltage levels of the product.  So this is where we maintain inventory to give us full flexibility should the shift change. Because we've always said, when we would have one or two platforms at a customer, if one vehicle sells better than the other, the customer would want to shift while still using onsemi. So we give that flexibility to be able to shift on between platforms at a similar OEM or between OEMs. So the best place to keep that inventory is blank wafers and/or Epi. 
Joshua Buchalter : So is it safe to assume that SiC's going to remain constrained through '24? 
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes, I believe so. It will be from our... 
Joshua Buchalter : Got it. For my follow-up, you called out bridge inventory to support the fab transitions and silicon carbide ramps. With days above 160, can you walk us through how this unwinds? Basically, I just want to make sure that as your peers are cutting inventory levels at their end customers that that won't become an issue as you complete some of the fab transitions and SiC ramps more fully. 
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. So strategic inventory for fab transition usually are committed backlog. We call it no change, no return. So we build the bridge inventory given that the customer needs that bridge between the old fab and the new fab. So we see this as a very low risk and will work itself down over a few quarters as we shut down the old fab. And before we start on the new fab, we will bleed inventory to a level, and then we'll ramp it back up into other fabs. So we don't see this as inventory jeopardy, which -- which allows us to be a little bit more comfortable with the elevated levels of inventory.  But one thing also Thad mentioned is the base inventory, actually, we drove that down, which is the one that you're more referring to would be at risk of demand. That's the one we've been managing down. That's the one we'll keep managing down with the lower utilization that Thad talked about. 
Thad Trent : Yes. And just to be clear, the fab transitions, the inventory for the fab transitions is primarily for the divested fabs that we've divested over the last year. So it takes 3-plus years to fully transition out of a fab. And in that situation, you build inventory and you bleed it off over time. But as Hassane said, we've got good visibility on that in a lot of cases, it's in C&R with those customers over a longer period of time. But it takes time. What we focus on is that base inventory, and we feel good that we're driving that down as that's down to about 102 days right now. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] The next question comes from Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley. 
Joseph Moore : I wonder if you could talk to pricing. Are you seeing anything that's different in terms of pricing given the historical dynamics? And is that different in the businesses that you're exiting versus the kind of core automotive businesses? 
Hassane El-Khoury: No, none of the outlook or the cautionary outlook that we've had has anything related to pricing. Our pricing is stable. It's locked into the LTSAs. The conversations we have had with customers regarding outlook, regarding inventory, regarding LTSA has all been around demand. Therefore, it's just following. So we feel pretty good about our price position. 
Joseph Moore : Great. And then I may have missed it. Did you give a number for how much business you'll be exiting in the current quarter? And can you talk to the dynamics of -- could that accelerate in an environment where there's more plentiful supply, would that help you to get out of those businesses quicker? 
Thad Trent : Yes. So we exited in $46 million in Q3, it was below our expectations. And coming back to your pricing question, we're just not seeing pricing decline enough that customers are exiting that business. We are looking -- as we look into Q4, we think there's about another $125 million that we would exit. That brings the year up to somewhere around $275 million, below what we originally forecasted.  Just as a point of reference, the businesses now that we're talking about exiting are at about a 45% gross margin. So it's not a bad business, assuming the pricing does hold up. The fact is, customers -- this is all customer-driven, customers aren't leaving as fast as we expected. I believe that at the end of this year, whatever is left, we're going to say is good business, and we're going to continue to manage if customers don't leave through the softness. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna. 
Christopher Rolland : I think the discussion for most broad-based guys are returning to the balance between bookings and backlog coverage going into a quarter and the turns business that is needed in the quarter. So I was wondering if you could perhaps talk about this for -- what's in your guide backlog coverage versus turns? And how should we be thinking about that for next year? If you can break it down into sub-segments too, that would be great as well. 
Hassane El-Khoury: Sure. The outlook is not -- has nothing to do with returning to turns business. We have full visibility about where the Q4 revenue is going to come in, including full backlog coverage. What we are talking about is getting the call ahead, which is the power of the LTSAs we keep talking about, where customers look at what their consumption is going to be and the consumption is lower than what they had expected. And of course, we're not here to push inventory to make the problem worse to our customers, so we negotiate a win-win with every single one of them.  So the outlook is purely demand. We know exactly what the mix is going to be. There is no turns business, even in the current quarter. And that, I would say, that comment is across all markets. 
Christopher Rolland : Okay. Great. Just maybe a quick follow-up there. are you seeing push-outs and cancellations or pushouts in those LTSAs? Is that why that number is lower? Just wondering why we had that sequential decrease in December. Maybe the Street was just mismodeling?  And then my other question is around -- you had some comments around industrial and solar in particular. I think we've seen guides like Enphase and SolarEdge missed pretty huge. It sounded like you had some very product-specific drivers there, but I was just wondering why you are so optimistic around that business when it's falling generally so fast. 
Thad Trent: Yes. I'll take the first part of your question on the cancellations. Look, we saw cancellations peak late last year. I would say at this point, as we look at the quarterly trends, it's pretty flat line at this point. So we're not seeing a lot of current quarter cancellations or even push outs within the forecast horizon here.  On the LTSAs, when a customer comes in and has a challenge as a onset, we're talking about a win-win with them. And in some cases, we are allowing some push outs as long as there's a win-win for both companies in that situation, we don't want to overship natural demand.  But in terms of cancellations, we're not seeing a spike. Like I said, we saw that peak late last year. 
Hassane El-Khoury: As far as industrial demand, you're right, I called out the renewable energy or energy storage. Those are all mega trends. The companies you referred to are more impacted by the residential, which obviously, is expected given the interest rates, given the consumer spending sentiment that I referred to earlier. The business we are targeting is the energy storage. A lot of it is larger-scale energy storage, which drives a lot more content. And it's not typically impacted by the residential specifically. That business has remained strong, and we expect that business to remain strong on a forward-looking basis. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Quinn Bolton with Needham & Company. 
Quinn Bolton : Just a clarification in response to one of the earlier questions, I think you said you were not looking for growth in the first half of the next year. Just wasn't sure if that was a sort of a sequential comment or a year-over-year comment, if you could clarify. And then I've got a follow-up on the silicon carbide business. 
Thad Trent : Yes. Look, it's Thad. We're cautiously looking at the first half of next year. We think it's going to be soft, but we do think there is sequential down in Q1, based on what we can see today. We'll look at the rest of the year as we go further. But we're being very cautious in the first half. 
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. My comment was more, I don't see a recovery, a market recovery. So it was more of a macro commentary. 
Quinn Bolton : Got it. And then on the silicon carbide business, you talked about overall utilization rates being managed down to 68% for the next few quarters to manage inventory. I assume, given the outlook for EVs still growing in the fourth quarter into next year, that the silicon carbide is probably immune from some of those lower utilization rates, but wanted to clarify that? And if utilization remains high in silicon carbide, could you actually see a scenario where silicon carbide moves above corporate average in 2024? 
Thad Trent: Yes, that's a good question. So the utilization for silicon carbide in Q3 was up, where silicon was down, and that pulled the total up. As we look forward, we don't see the silicon carbide utilization decreasing. We will be bringing on additional capacity next year to support '25 and beyond. But I don't expect that utilization to decline. I think it's the silicon that will actually decline, that gets us down into that 65% to -- mid-60% to high-60% range. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Vijay Rakesh with Mizuho. 
Vijay Rakesh : Just a quick question on your commentary on softer demand with higher inventory, I guess. Is that more -- is that pretty -- what are you seeing across the board in both combustion engine and EV? Or can you characterize that a little better? 
Hassane El-Khoury: Well, it's hard to -- for a lot of the general content in automotive, it's hard to figure out if it's EV or not. But I can tell you, it's not silicon carbide. It's not IGBT. It's not the EV-specific constraint. It's more of a general -- I would call it, general purpose automotive demand that can go in either car. But given the volume for EV, it's more driven by the internal combustion demand because that's where the volume is skewed to. 
Vijay Rakesh : Got it. And then as you look at your silicon carbide road map, you talked about 2024 might be a transition to 200-millimeter. Is that still something that you see? And what's your expectation on what mix would be on 200 millimeter, let's say, exiting '24? 
Hassane El-Khoury: So what we've -- so we're on track to what we've always said. We're finished qualifying and the conversion started. I talked about in my prepared remarks. For 200-millimeter, we feel very comfortable and actually more confident today than we were even 90 days ago on the 200-millimeter, given the performance that we've had in the silicon carbide business, ramping all the way from substrates, all the way through devices. The fabs are ready, Epi is ready, and furnaces started conversion. So our plan has always been qualify '24 and ramp revenue in '25. So you're not going to really see a mix shift in '24, that would be more of a '25, '24 is when we transition manufacturing to the 200-millimeter. 
Vijay Rakesh : Got it. And last question, when you look at silicon carbide, when do you start to see it getting accretive to the corporate margins, I guess? 
Thad Trent : Well, so we're going to hit the corporate average in Q4, as I said. As you go into next year, I think it's going to be at or above, depending on kind of what the market does. And that's going to be dependent on overall utilization. But we'll definitely be at parity and potentially higher in 2024. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Timothy Arcuri with UBS. 
Timothy Arcuri : I just wanted to ask a question also on the 2023 silicon carbide cut from $1 billion down to $800 million. You guys have always talked about the LTSAs being legally binding, and it didn't seem like they would be subject to any changes in EV ramps. It sounded like a little bit of a higher bar than what we hear from others. So can you talk about that? Was that some structural change in a program from one of your customers where something is just permanently pushed out? Or should we still expect that -- you're not getting this year, does that push into next year? 
Hassane El-Khoury: So obviously, I'm not going to comment on specific customer details, specifically on programs. But I will comment on the LTSAs. So the LTSAs are legally binding. Therefore, for us to agree or even acknowledge that push out or even the demand in general outside of silicon carbide in Q4, there has to have been, which there is, a win-win for us and the customer. We've always said, if anything, the LTSAs get us a phone call. We get the phone call way ahead of time in certain areas when the customer knows that it's coming. And we're able to manage with the customer for a win-win, whether that win-win is a quarter later or a year later or a longer term that depends on case by case. So we manage it with the customer because what we don't want is, of course, enforce the LTSA at the expense of just shipping inventory if demand is lower. So we take it very cautiously. We have -- it has to be a win for us, but also a win for the customer, and that's what keeps the strategic customers engaging. 
Timothy Arcuri : Got it. Got it. Sure. So given that, is the commitment still to $4.5 billion between '23 and '25, so that we still have $3.7 million left between '24 and '25? 
Hassane El-Khoury: We're not commenting on that. What I have commented is, obviously, if you take the growth rate that I described in 2024, and you can compare it to where we were before. So no change in our outlook. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tristan Gerra with Baird. 
Tristan Gerra : I just wanted to expand a little bit on the coverage for next year for LTSA. Obviously, I'm guessing that you don't have full year coverage like you did entering this year, but could you talk about maybe percentage-wise? Or when is the average LTA expiring next year? Just wanted to kind of look at the transition for LTSA into notably the second half of next year. 
Thad Trent : Yes. So what you'll see in our filing is that we've got $5.7 billion of LTSA commitment over the next 12 months. So hopefully, that gets you in the ballpark there. 
Tristan Gerra : Okay. And what's the average duration? And how should we look at how some of those are unwinding later next year or even in '25? 
Thad Trent : Yes. So the number I gave you is the 12 months -- from this point forward, 12 months. Now your question is a broader question about LTSAs in general. So the LTSAs go out 3 to 5 years on average, sometimes much longer. It just depends on the customer situation. I think last quarter, we talked about customers coming back, extending LTSAs or expanding LTSAs. So it just -- as these things come up for renewal, customers are coming in and engaging. I would say the customers are looking over the long term versus the short term when it comes to the negotiation and the extension of LTSAs. 
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Chris Caso with Wolfe Research. 
Chris Caso: Yes. Thank you. I think I'll just go back to the commentary on silicon carbide into next year. Just some of the questions coming in during the call, there was some uncertainty that I hope we could resolve. So what -- my interpretation of what you're saying is silicon carbide, it sounds like it's down significantly in Q4, given the fact that it's a majority of the decline here. But you're also suggesting that it grows next year and you stay supply constrained. So that would suggest that what you're implying is some improvement at some point next year in silicon carbide. How do we just reconcile those comments, unless we got some of them wrong? 
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. So the -- I guess, I would say the one comment that I believe you got wrong is Q4 in silicon carbide is not down. Q4 silicon carbide is growth from Q3. It is just not at the level that we expected. That's what drove the mix. So it is not silicon carbide going backwards.  With that correction and the ramps that we're starting -- we have in Q3 and will continue to ramp in Q4, plus the breadth of customers that I described, those are going to drive sequential growth through 2024. So silicon carbide is not down quarter -- will not be down quarter-on-quarter. Q3, Q4, it will be up, and it will continue to be up in subsequent quarters through Q4. 
Chris Caso : That's very helpful. Yes. Yes. And just moving on to CapEx for silicon carbide as we go to next year. And your earlier comments suggest this is long-term investment. But given the current environment, are there any changes to the investments that you were planning for calendar '24? Although certainly, it sounds like you'd continue to invest, what do we expect for the CapEx profile next year in light of the change in environment? 
Thad Trent : Yes. Chris, in my prepared remarks, I noted that because of our strong performance in silicon carbide being ahead of our internal plans and our confidence in moving into 200-millimeter that we're actually taking our capital intensity in 2024 down. We had expected the high-teens for 2024. I'm now saying it's low-teens, and it's quickly closing in on that long-term target. So we will continue to make investments, but not at the rate that we needed to just because of the performance across the entire manufacturing chain is ahead of schedule and exceeding our expectations.
Operator: [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from William Stein with Truist Securities. 
William Stein : I'm hoping you can discuss the dynamics in the industrial end market. This is where we're seeing more weakness from other semi companies and similar component manufacturers over the last quarter. The call has been very focused on the change in outlook in silicon carbide, but I'd love for you to discuss trends more broadly in the industrial end market and your expectations as we progress into next year. 
Hassane El-Khoury: Yes. So for industrial, obviously, we see the same as a lot of our broad-based peers, so weakness in industrial. However, within industrial, I called out the two areas that we have seen and will continue to see strength. That's the renewable energy that we talked about earlier with energy storage and so on. And the medical, both driven by very specific trends on the energy storage. Obviously, it is the renewable deployment. Not just not the residential scale, but more commercial scale that's driving a lot of the strength. And on the medical, it is a very specific trend of accessibility of the continuous glucose and the hearing aid, which is now almost over-the-counter that's driving a lot of that demand for us. And given that we have a leadership position here, we're seeing that strength.  So outside of these two, we do see the softness across industrial. 2024, I commented, we don't expect 2024 to see a very big change in recovery. So you can call it -- we'll call it when we get closer to it. But I don't have signs that will change the -- my view of the trend and outlook. 
Operator: Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Q&A portion of today's conference. I'd like to turn the call back over to Hassane El-Khoury for any closing remarks. 
Hassane El-Khoury: Thank you again for joining our call. As always, we aim to deliver consistency and transparency in our results, and we thank you for your support along the way. The executive staff and I are incredibly proud of our team's continued performance, dedication to our customers and commitment to delivering shareholder value. Our employees all over the world are solving complex technology and business problems for customers. Congratulations to the team, and thank you all. 
Operator: Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect, and have a wonderful day."
5733,RIVN,3,2023,2023-11-07 20:30:25,"Operator: Good day, and thank you for standing by. Welcome to the Rivian Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today, Tim Bei, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.
Tim Bei: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us for Rivian's third quarter 2023 earnings call. Before we begin, matters discussed on this call, including comments and responses to questions reflect management's views as of today. We will also be making statements related to our business operations and financial performance that may be considered forward-looking statements under federal securities laws. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially. These risks and uncertainties are described in our SEC filings and today's shareholder letter. During this call, we will discuss both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP financial measures is provided in our shareholder letter. Just before the call, we published our shareholder letter, which includes an overview of our progress over the recent months. I encourage you to read it for additional details around some of the items we'll cover on today's call. With that, I'll turn the call over to RJ, who will begin with a few opening remarks.
RJ Scaringe: Thanks, Tim. Hello, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. During our call, I will highlight key developments during the third quarter and provide an update on the progress we are making against our core value drivers. Importantly, I want to take this opportunity to provide some broader perspective on the EV space. There has been a lot of noise and a lot of dialogue recently around EV adoption, and I want to emphatically state just how deeply convicted we are that the entire automotive industry will be transitioning to electric over the next one to two decades. We've built and designed our business around this transition. We've designed our team structure, our technology stack, the way we've approached vertical integration to not only help our business scale profitably, but to ensure we are positioned to be a leader in this generational opportunity. We believe a substantial competitive advantage is our approach to vertically integrating our in-vehicle computers, software stack and propulsion platform, along with our efficient direct-to-consumer, go-to-market strategy. R2 will benefit from investments we've made in R1 and will represent our first global platform. Additionally, Rivian's production ramp and introduction of multiple vehicle platforms in our Illinois plant has provided significant learnings in a compressed timeframe. Our team will apply this experience to our new manufacturing facility in Georgia with the goal of achieving a considerably lower cost structure. Now, in the short-term, I want to acknowledge the macroeconomic and geopolitical pressures impacting consumers and businesses, most notably the increase in interest rates. In this context, we remain laser focused on the factors within our control, driving greater cost efficiency, continuing to ramp production, investing in differentiated technologies, continuing to enhance the Rivian customer experience, and maintaining a strong balance sheet. Our financial and operating results during the third quarter of 2023 represent progress on each of these fronts. Before I get into the third quarters milestones of performance, I wanted to touch on an important new development, which was just released. We have amended our Amazon agreement with terms and conditions, which provide the opportunity to sell commercial vans to other customers, helping more companies reduce their CO2 emissions. With more than 10,000 EDVs on the road and 260 million delivered packages, we are already seeing meaningful impact from our initial rollout. We are excited to continue our work with Amazon to deliver on their initial order of 100,000 vehicles, along with a diverse set of new commercial customers.  We are confident in the value of our vans, software and services offerings can provide fleet customers and are in active discussions with a number of large potential fleet customers to launch pilot programs. It's important to appreciate that the sales cycle for commercial vans typically begins with lower volume pilot programs. The most recent quarter demonstrated sequential production growth, further improvement in our profitability per vehicle, introduction of a new Max Pack variant, with up to 410 miles of range, rollout of multiple over-the-air updates to enhance the customer experience and focused investment on commercial infrastructure to support our expanding fleet of vehicles. Within the plant, we continue to see progress across our production lines. We produced 16,304 vehicles during the third quarter and continue to ramp our Enduro Drive unit line. As a result of this, we are raising our production guidance for the year to 54,000 total units. Later this month, we plan to take about a week of downtime for validation builds to support the incorporation of engineering design changes into the R1 platform, which will be implemented in the planned downtime in the second quarter of 2024, which we discussed in the last earnings call. These new technologies include our simplified electronic control unit topology and cost reductions across a variety of areas, including the vehicle harness, body structure, and battery pack. These technology changes represent Rivian's continued emphasis on driving greater cost efficiency. They will significantly contribute to driving towards Rivian's long-term gross margin targets. Rivian vehicles have now driven over 490 million miles, which provides us with great data and feedback on how our vehicles perform in different environments and what features can be added or enhanced to improve our customer experience. This past quarter, we pushed major over-the-air updates, which improved ride quality, enhance the towing experience, and offer customers a new way to interact with the different drive modes. Over 90% of our customers update their software within five days of it becoming available. It's great to see this level of engagement with our software. Later this quarter, we plan to launch our leasing platform on select R1T vehicles in certain regions. We look forward to offering this as a new way for our customers to take delivery of Rivian and plan to expand the lease offering to additional regions across more vehicles as the program matures. We currently have 45 service centers, along with 408 mobile service vehicles. In addition, we recently opened Rivian spaces, our version of retail stores in Vancouver, Seattle, Chicago, Brooklyn, Nashville, Atlanta, and Denver. Our DC fast-charging network also continues to expand. We currently have 57 Rivian Adventure Network charging sites. Progress continued on the development of the R2 platform, as well as preparing the future production site in Georgia. I was just there a few weeks ago. It's great to see the site starting to take form, which is the direct result of a strong collaboration between the state, local community, and Rivian. It was a strong quarter as we continued to deliver on our operational and financial goals. I would like to thank our employees, customers, partners, suppliers, communities, and shareholders for their continued support of our vision. With that, I'll pass the call to Claire.
Claire McDonough: Thanks, RJ. I would like to reiterate that our team is focused on four key value drivers: driving greater cost efficiency, continuing to ramp production, investing in differentiated technologies, and continuing to enhance the Rivian customer experience. Third quarter results demonstrate advancement in each of these aspects of our business. During the third quarter, we produced 16,304 vehicles and delivered 15,564 vehicles, which was the primary driver of the $1.3 billion of revenue we generated. Total gross profit for the quarter was negative $477 million. We remain focused on improving our gross profit per vehicle delivered. During the third quarter, our gross loss per vehicle improved by approximately $2,000 versus the second quarter. This improvement would have been approximately $14,000 better, excluding the impact of the change in LCNRV and losses on firm purchase commitments. So therefore, LCNRV and losses on firm purchase commitments more significantly contributed to the improvement in gross profit during the second quarter as compared to the third quarter, highlighting the improvements we have made in ramping production and reducing the material cost of our vehicles. As a reminder, when our LCNRV balance and losses on firm purchase commitments declines, it reduces cost of goods sold and positively contributes to gross profit. We expect by the end of 2024, we will no longer have material LCNRV inventory charges associated with the production at our Illinois plant as we reach positive gross profit. Our adjusted EBITDA for the quarter was negative $942 million. In October of this year, we raised a $1.75 billion green convertible note, which further strengthens our balance sheet as we approach the expected start of construction of our Georgia plant early next year. By maintaining a strong balance sheet, we are well positioned as we look to start production of the R2 platform in 2026. The offering was not completed until after the quarter end. Accordingly, the $1.6 billion of net proceeds from the raise was not included in our Q3 2023 ending cash balance of $9.1 billion. Turning to our business outlook for 2023. We remain focused on ramping production and driving greater cost efficiency across the company. Based on the progress we've seen year-to-date across our manufacturing process and our cost down efforts, we are raising each aspect of our 2023 annual guidance. We are raising our production guidance to 54,000 units, improving EBITDA guidance to negative $4 billion and lowering our CapEx guidance to $1.1 billion. The improvement in estimated CapEx is driven mostly by timing of spend and by our efforts to reduce costs across the business. As a reminder, because Amazon limits the intake of new commercial vans during its peak holiday delivery period, we expect a more significant gap between production and deliveries in Q4 relative to prior periods. As RJ mentioned, and as we discussed on last quarter's earnings call, we expect to shut down both the consumer and commercial lines in our Illinois facility in the second quarter of 2024 to introduce a number of new in-vehicle technologies to the R1 platform. We believe these changes will meaningfully reduce our material costs and position Rivian to exit 2024 with a much improved margin profile. We are planning to adjust the production rate of the lines whereby the planned annual capacity will be for 85,000 units for R1 and 65,000 units for EDV, keeping the total facility at an annual capacity of 150,000 units. Our downtime in Q2 2024 and associated ramp up in Q2 and Q3 2024 is expected to impact roughly two quarters of production. While the incorporation of new design changes impacts near-term production, we are confident it better positions Rivian to be more profitable and competitive over the long-term. Overall, we continue to see a clear path to our approximately 25% gross margin target, high-teens adjusted EBITDA margin target, and approximately 10% free cash flow margin target. With that, let me turn the call back to the operator to open the line for Q&A.
Operator: Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Rod Lache with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.
Rod Lache: Hi, everybody. I have a question on cost and a question on demand. Just first, my impression is that you're making better-than-expected progress on costs, just simply because you improved your gross loss by $16,000 ex-LCNRV. I didn't see any average price improvement and presumably volume isn't helping you just yet because you haven't gotten the contribution margin positive on the R1. So is that correct? Because it is interesting since you haven't yet benefited from the new architecture of the Pack and all the other things that are coming into 2024.
Claire McDonough: Thanks for the question, Rod. As you think about the key drivers and the margin improvement that we saw over the last quarter, it was driven by the 23% increase that we saw in delivery volumes. So there was some fixed cost leverage. But we also saw significant improvements in material costs which was driven both by a mix shift to greater concentration of EDV delivery volumes. So roughly about 30% of our revenue in Q3 was from the sales of the EDV itself, which is, as you mentioned, is a higher margin, already contribution margin positive for Rivian vehicle platform for us. But beyond the EDV, we also saw significant material cost savings as well for R1, driven by the continued work of our procurement team as we've been renegotiating many of our supply agreements. And then it also incorporated some of the early sales of our dual motor to consumers as well that benefited the reduction in material costs. In addition to those two key levers, we also saw continued softening in the broader logistics market and space. And so that was also a contributor to the improvement that we saw on a per unit basis for Q3.
Rod Lache: That's helpful. So yes, the contribution margin must be on the RCVs. On the demand side, could you talk about how quickly you can expand the RCV to other customers? I understand that there's a process with pilots and planning with these fleets. But any thoughts on how we can think about RCV sales into 2024 or 2025? And on the R1, you're currently on – at 65,000 units, you will be at 85,000 units at the end of next year capacity presumably, you'd need at least 180 orders per average day just to meet like your current capacity. Maybe you could talk a little bit about whether you're seeing convergence to that kind of a number. What's the trajectory of demand that you're seeing in the orders?
RJ Scaringe: Hi, Rod. Thanks for your question on the commercial vehicle and R1. Just to speak first on the commercial vehicle side. Of course, we've been working on the exclusivity agreement with Amazon for a while, and we've talked about this in past earnings calls. So it's not as if we were surprised by that this morning. And with that, we've been building the relationships with a diverse set of commercial operators, and that's everything from last mile to retail, to a wide variety of industrial or commercial business cases which require – businesses that require commercial vans. And while the fleet and the use cases are diverse, the one element that's very common for these large fleets is the necessity of running pilots as a way to prep the network or prep the system to ingest a completely different type of vehicle in terms of its need for charging infrastructure, and as well as changes to the standard operating procedure for those respective businesses. And so what we'll be announcing soon is a range of different pilot programs that will perceive much larger orders, as these large fleets start to plan the electrification of their infrastructure. As it pertains to R1, of course, you can see in the numbers for Q3, we continue to maintain an extremely strong market share position at the price points at which the R1 platform operates. So as you think about volume of vehicles, electric vehicles sold, let's say, at over $75,000 price point. We're a very significant market share player, that the brand is connected incredibly well with consumers. And we're seeing that translate to not only continued excitement for the brand, but we see that really manifest as really strong residual values and in particular, really strong used vehicle pricing. So Google search of used Rivian R1S will just reveal just how robust the pricing and therefore, the demand for these products are. So with that said, this is before we've even launched a number of additional variants that are going to be coming online. We've just recently launched Max Pack. We've launched the Dual-Motor. But early next year, we'll be launching our standard battery pack. We'll be launching additional trim configuration. And importantly, starting now or starting later this month, we're going to be launching, on select models as you heard Claire and I described in the opening statements. Select model is a leasing program, and that leasing program creates a different way for customers to access the product, which is really helpful in an environment with interest rates as we see them today. So we remain very bullish on R1 program and its long-term demand, and as I indicated, I think the RCV platform, our commercial van platform really is in our view, the best commercial van option available for fleet of for any sort of large fleet, and we're working very hard to translate that into volume over the course of the next several quarters with these pilot programs that I referred to at the start.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of John Murphy of Bank of America. Your line is now open.
John Murphy: Good evening, guys. Just a quick question on the fourth quarter implied volumes. It looks like they're a fair amount lower than what you did in the third quarter on production. I'm just curious, is this is a question of days in the calendar? Or is there something else going on sort of in the plan? Is it what you mentioned on the Amazon deliveries where you might downshift the EDV a little bit? I mean what's going on there?
RJ Scaringe: Yes. Claire spoke to this in her opening statements, but we have – we're planning a longer shutdown in the second quarter of 2024, to implement a whole host of changes that introduced a dramatic reduction in our material costs of building materials for the R1 platform. But those changes also improve the operations of the plant and allow us to produce vehicles with less labor per vehicle, and therefore, less cost per vehicle. Preceding that shutdown in Q2 2024, we have a one-week shutdown in Q4. And that's planned to do some of the longer lead changes in the plant, and it requires us to shut down all production for approximately a week. So you're certainly seeing that in the numbers. And then I'd say broadly, we're also recognizing some of the days lost around the holidays associated with Christmas and, of course, the New Year holiday.
John Murphy: Okay. And then just one follow-up on the physical service network build-out. RJ, how are you sizing that at the moment? Because I mean that's obviously something that you're getting way ahead of the customer needs there. How you're locating, deciding on locations, what's the cost of those, and how are you sizing those?
RJ Scaringe: Yes. As you know, we've – and we've talked about this in the past, in past earnings calls, we are building a service footprint that relies on both physical brick-and-mortar service locations, we'll have about 50 of those in the U.S. by the end of this year. But supplementing that and actually performing a majority of our service are mobile service vehicles. And our mobile service vehicle fleet, as I said, at the start is more than 400 vehicles, today, it's – as of, I think, this week, it's 408, but it continues to grow. And that the beauty of mobile service-first strategy is from a customer point of view, it's a much easier process. So if there's an issue on the vehicle rather than you as the customer having to deal with the vehicle being dropped off or taken to a service center, we simply come to you, we come to your house, we come to your place of business, and perform the service on site. And more than half – well over half of all of our service operations there, mobile, we expect that to shift into greater than three quarters of all service operations will be performed with mobile service. Now that doesn't completely relieve the need for physical infrastructure. The physical infrastructure is important for more significant service activities. And as I said, that's why we continue to grow and invest in that network, and we'll see that growing where – since we put service locations closest to where we have large pools or large pockets of demand.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joseph Spak with UBS. Your line is now open.
Joseph Spak: Thanks so much everyone. Claire, I know you sort of talked a little bit about some of the puts and takes into next year. But you're right now running at a $65,000 run rate this quarter. So in the context of the downtime and the 150,000 total capacity, how should we be thinking about next year's potential? Is that sort of 65 run rate about the right level you guys are planning for next year?
Claire McDonough: So as you mentioned, there's going to be a number of puts and takes overall. And it's important to note that the impacts of the shutdown are temporary in nature, but the benefits will be there for the future, and RJ spoke briefly to – just the magnitude of technology changes that will be introduced into the R1 vehicles next year that creates a true step change in our material cost road map, and past deposit gross profit margin for us as a whole. So as you think about the cadence of the year, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, right, we'll start Q1, akin to our current and existing run rate. And then Q2 and Q3 will be heavily impacted quarters from a production standpoint, where we'll take multiple weeks of downtime throughout the course of Q2. And then we'll be ramping up all of the respective variance of R1, both in Q2 and into Q3 as well. And then as we've talked about in the past, Q4 becomes that run rate potential for the business where you'll see Rivian continuing to ramp up our volumes from a production standpoint for both R1, as well as our commercial volumes. You'll see the full impacts of each of the new technologies, hitting our material costs, that also coincides with a significant percentage of the commercial cost down opportunity that we have in front of us as well. And so those elements come together in connection as well with Rivian fulfilling our pre-3/1/2022 preorders, which also results in a step change in our average selling price of the vehicle over that period of time as well. So next year is certainly a year of different puts and takes, but that's directionally how I would think about the volume cadence.
Joseph Spak: Okay. That's helpful. And actually, that danced nicely into my next question. RJ or Claire, I mean, you've talked about this in the past about the higher ASPs with the backlog. And RJ, you sort of mentioned some of the affordability concerns out there in EVs, but really, I'd say, in broader auto as well, at least in the headlines. So clearly, you have good visibility on your backlog through 2024. But how are you thinking about or planning for the margin profile for the business once you get past that, like if affordability is a greater concern, do you have enough line of sight on cost reduction initiatives or other efforts to sort of help balance out what might be a little bit of a tougher pricing environment?
RJ Scaringe: Yes, we've talked about this a bit in the past, but when we think about the R1 platform, we launched with Quad-Motor Large Pack, that's our middle-sized pack and one trim configuration. And what we've done over the last few months as we start to introduce additional build combinations above and beyond that. So we introduced the Dual-Motor, that's built around our Enduro Motor platform. We, of course, introduced our Max Pack, which is our largest battery pack. Next year, we'll be introducing our standard pack, which is our smallest battery pack, and we'll be introducing a variety of different trim and build combinations along with that over the course of the next year. And what that does is it provides us with a broader spread of prices or price choices for consumers on the R1 platform to essentially be able to target both the most price-sensitive customers, as well as customers are looking to buy sort of the fully loaded maximum content vehicle. And what that effectively does is it allows us to benefit from the higher margin profile on these higher price, full content vehicles and balance it with the lower priced, lower content vehicles and still look at it as we look at that in the lens of ASP, still see ASP grow over time. And a big contributor to that, which Claire alluded to is, as we start to blend in newer pricing and we move past the pre-March 1, 2022 pricing, that's also going to have an accretive effect on overall ASP. The other thing to keep in mind from a demand point of view, is just the scale of the segments that we're operating in. The three row SUV space and the pickup segment represent very large pools of demand. And of course, across those large pools of demand, there's a range of prices, but this is a really important element for us, is just recognizing how much overall demand potential there is, and we're seeing with increased awareness and excitement for the brand that translate to lots and lots of new EV customers. The other thing which is worth just bringing up in the context of some of the negotiations that we've had with R1, is the bill of material cost reductions we're seeing, and these are significant, and we're going to see them quarter-over-quarter. I've described the performance like this staircase set of changes quarter-over-quarter, with a big step being that which comes in quarter two of next year. But we've been able to leverage suppliers excitement for R2 to achieve materially lower costs in our bill of materials that will start to layer in along with what comes in Q2, but even beyond that. And so R2 is sort of this incredible carrot for suppliers. And one of the things that's become very clear, particularly in the last two to three quarters is just how well the Rivian brand is resonating, and suppliers are recognizing relative to some of the other customers, just how much volume we're delivering and how much demand there is for our products, relative to a wide variety of established brands, and they recognize that, that excitement for our brand will also translate to lower price points. And the R2 captures the essence of our brand, but of course, to a smaller package and in a much lower price point.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Mark Delaney with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. You reiterated your view to be gross margin positive in 2024, but I'm hoping to better understand if you're views in how Rivian will get there, have changed at all recently, given the volatility in the industry more broadly with competitors cutting EV vehicle prices, but also costs falling in Rivian, as you've described, making so much progress on its own cost structure.
RJ Scaringe: Thanks, Mark. I'll let Claire jump in on this as well. This is just such an important topic. And ultimately, there's – I just spoke to it a bit, but there's a few major levers. The first being, the continued ramp-up of our production facility and the fixed cost absorption that comes with that. We're seeing the benefits of that quarter-over-quarter as we continue to ramp. So it's numerically very easy to understand. The second, which is maybe less – it's not as easy to see without having a look into all of our supplier negotiations and discussions is the significant progress we're making contractually with redefining build material costs or material costs through negotiations with suppliers, through resourcing of new suppliers, or through changes to the component or system design to achieve those cost reductions. And the shutdown that we have in second quarter of next year of 2024, will allow us to implement a large bundling of all of those changes, both in terms of suppliers, part design changes, component changes. I've talked about this a lot in the past, but massive consolidation of our ECU topology, massive simplification of our harness, simplification of our body structure, simplification of the HVAC system in the vehicle. So there's big changes that are going to be coming as part of that shutdown. And we saw similar – it's worth noting with the commercial vehicle, with the EDV, when we had the shutdown earlier this year, we had a 35% reduction in our material costs associated with the consolidated set of changes we made with that shutdown. So we're expecting and anticipating a similar level of step change in our material costs following the shutdown. And then lastly, which I spoke to a moment ago is growth in ASP. And that's going to be both due to the layering in or the feathering in of new pricing, which again, we'll just see quarter-over-quarter as more and more of our deliveries are associated with new pricing, meaning post-March 1, 2022, as we work through that. And then the other is the introduction of some of these new trim packages, Max Pack, is an example, we have some new trim configurations going to be coming out next year that will also help us grow ASP. So it's a combination of ramp, material cost and ASP that give us a very high degree of confidence in our long-term gross margin for the business.
Mark Delaney: Yes. Thanks for that RJ. And my follow-up was on a related topic on margins. Last quarter, you spoke about your expectation for R1 to be contribution margin positive exiting this year. Is that still your expectation? Thank you.
Claire McDonough: Mark, we still expect R1 to be contribution margin positive exiting this year for newly priced units.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chris McNally with Evercore. Your line is now open.
Chris McNally: Thanks so much team. Sorry to follow on the same topic. But if we – I wanted to look at that sort of the shape of the gross profit progression as we think about next year. And so in just paraphrasing, could we think about this minus 30 – 2000 per vehicle, as sort of linearly getting better in Q4 and Q1? And then obviously, there's a big step change. You talked about all of the massive improvements in the architecture of Q2. You have some re-ramp in Q3. So I don't want to put – it's going to be a more complex number. But coming out of Q3 into Q4, that's where we should start to really see the gross profit ramp probably well through positive because then, obviously, you have targets in 2025 that include double-digit gross profit. Does that sound like a shape where you get a big change out of the Q2, Q3 into Q4 because that's where a large amount of the architecture costs change out?
Claire McDonough: Yes. So Chris, as you think about the near-term cadence, one area I wanted to just call out is, as I mentioned in Rob's question, EDV was a significant contributor to our Q3 margin improvement itself. And so as you look to Q4, given the seasonality of Amazon's business, that will be a fraction of the volume that they took in Q3 of this year. And so you won't see this linear path from Q3 to Q4 in terms of the gross profit losses per unit, they are just given some of the mix shift. As you look to Q1, you'll see more similar types of dynamics, especially as you start to ramp up greater volumes of our Enduro Drive units, where you're seeing some of the new technology introductions that we have in R1, you'll see the benefits of Max Pack as well, throughout the course of Q4 and Q1, that are contributing to the cost down road map for R1. And then as you mentioned, if you were to just look at the material cost trajectory, that's where you'll see the significant step change, really in the second half of 2024, as each of the new technologies that we'll be introducing will start to go into production in the line as well. And so that's going to be that step change in terms of gross margin improvement. However, that step change will be mitigated by some volume-related impacts given our production rates for Q2 and Q3. And so Q4 is where you'll see more of the run rate potential coming out of the shutdown itself, and the full complement of material cost downs included within the vehicles themselves.
Chris McNally: Makes sense. I guess there's a lot of moving parts. But basically, if we think about next year, there's a Q1 clean quarter, and Q4, obviously, clean, again, there will be the EDV issues then. But basically, it all comes out of Q4. So okay, in terms of the shape, that all makes sense. One of the areas you've also been really improving upon has been on the OpEx side. And I'm just curious how do we think about if we run rate going into next year, when do we have to start to build in some OpEx for Georgia prework, some obviously can be capitalized. But do we have to start to build in an OpEx investment as I think about for 2024? Thank you.
Claire McDonough: As you think about the OpEx drivers, you'll start to see Georgia pick up in 2024. But beyond that, you'll also see more material investments as we approach the 2024 shutdown to introduce new technology. So as our team today is increasing the number of prototypes we're building in advance of the shutdown and increasing the level of engineering, design and development work that we're doing with our supply partners for those new technology introductions, you're seeing a little bit of a tick up of R&D that you'll see throughout the second half of this year and into the first half of next year itself. But in aggregate, we don't expect a material increase. We'll certainly see some continued increases across the board, but we'll continue to maintain sort of the slight increased level that we've seen of late over the longer term.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Emmanuel Rosner with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.
Emmanuel Rosner: Thank you very much. So it's exciting to hear that you'll be able to sell the commercial vehicles to other customers. I was wondering if you can try and help us with a directional sense of volume split between that and the Amazon one, and also timing. So after the re-rate next year, you'll have, I think, 65,000 units of capacity for the commercial vehicles. How quickly or around what timeline do you think that you would be able to essentially fill that capacity between your current customers and any new one?
RJ Scaringe: As I spoke to before, the sales process for commercial customers really, is that relatively long sort of lead time process whereby it's important for these large fleet operators to run pilot programs, both to understand the unique idiosyncrasies of the vehicle, but also to understand what changes are necessary from an infrastructure point of view. And as is often the case, where the vehicles will be based out of their ""hub"", wasn't originally designed with a lot of power. So it doesn't have necessarily power to support daily charging or night charging of the vehicles. And that takes time to install that. We've learned this – some of the challenges associated with converting existing facilities to support large EV fleets. We've learned this through the lens of our relationship with Amazon very clearly. And so those pilot programs, which will be kicking off, we'll be announcing a number of them shortly, will lead to larger volumes, but we want to be careful to just set expectations in the right way that these pilot programs will take some time. And so we think of this as some volume associated with both the pilots and orders that come following the pilots in 2024, but the significant opportunity really starts to kick in, in 2025, as these larger customers transition from pilot to at scale development.
Emmanuel Rosner: Okay. That's helpful. And then my second question is on CapEx. So obviously, quite a big cut again to this year's guidance. I think you've mentioned among other factors, timing delays. I guess historically when you've lowered the CapEx over the last few quarters or so, there was no real increase in CapEx for the future periods. But how should we think about this particular cost? Like, are you going to see something next year in terms of CapEx at higher than what you previously contemplated or in the end, leave it at your regular framework?
Claire McDonough: So Emmanuel, what we've talked about in the past has been approximately $2 billion or on average, between 2023 and 2024. I'd say that we'll be in a position to be below that average, just slightly below that average, if you think about the trajectory and the significance of cuts that we've had in 2023 itself. It's really been driven by both some improvements that we've had in terms of longer-dated payment terms, on some of the work that we're doing within our production facility and with our equipment purchases, as well as the episodic nature of some of our investments, predominantly surrounding the shutdown and introduction of new technologies that's really the largest contributor to the reductions that we've made this year that will hit in the early part of 2024.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Colin Langan with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open.
Colin Langan: Oh, great. Thanks for taking my questions. If I look at gross profit ex the LCNRV, it's trending, I think, close to $38,000 a vehicle, and that has improved a lot from Q1, where I think it was close to $80,000, but still quite a big gap to get to the gross profit. I mean I think in Q1, you kind of framed like a certain percent was leverage, certain price, service engineering, certain price downs. Any sort of framework how we get from the sort of $38,000 today to the breakeven, what are sort of the main drivers from here? Is it mostly the pricing and engineering at this point? Or is there still some leverage or?
Claire McDonough: So the three drivers remain as you think about them being the fixed cost leverage that we'll get from increased volume from current state to the end of 2024, as well as the material cost down trajectory and improvements in average selling price as a whole. As you look at the progress that we've made over the course of this year, that's largely been driven by the improvements that we've seen in fixed cost leverage from the production ramp, as well as the progress that we've been making on material costs, given the technologies we've introduced in EDV, which RJ referenced, resulted in a 35% improvement in our material cost in the EDV itself, and then continued progress against, both the introduction of new technologies such as the Dual-Motor introductions that we've had in R1. And then beyond that, we've also continued to see progress, as RJ mentioned, in the visibility that we have today in our contractual agreements with supplier partners that are continuing to come down as we look both to the business in the future. The other key that we've seen has been around the commodities environment and backdrop. And to date, you're not really seeing the softness in some of the key battery cell raw materials are reflected in our current results. So some of that trajectory is still to come as you think about impacts for the end of this year and into 2024 as well.
RJ Scaringe: I think Claire and I both spoke to this, but it's important to call out, when we talk about material cost reductions and pulling overall our BOM costs down, These are contractual, meaning, this isn't like, us sitting over here, hoping that this is going to come down. These are detailed contractual negotiations, part by part, supplier by supplier, and the effectivity data in some of these where it's, let's say, just a pure negotiation on a part that's not going to change or on a supply that's not going to change, we've been able to accelerate the effectivity date to have already happened or to be happening prior to the shutdown in Q2 of 2024. But for some of the larger changes and things like, let's say, for example, the significant consolidation of ECUs that were driving or the massive refactoring harness that takes roughly 25% of the harness length out. Those involve engineering changes that involve new suppliers and completely new supplier contracts. And so the bundling of some of those big multi-thousand dollar changes that have effectivity dates in April, it's – we have the 100% confidence those are going to occur. Those are, again, I'm using the word here is – clearly, again, these are contractual agreements. But the contractual agreements have an effectivity date and they tie to when we start production with those new components. So as we look at this transition, the continued ramp, as I said earlier, that's – we understand the – that's just the numerics of fixed cost absorption. And on the BOM cost side, it's just understanding what – I understand it's hard for all of you to see, but very clear for us to see the contractual obligations that we've negotiated with all of our suppliers.
Colin Langan: I guess I think in Q1, you had kind of indicated half of the gap was leverage and then it was like a quarter price, and then 1/4 is supplier and engineering. At this point where you have already cut it in half, I mean how should we think between those three items? Is it now equally 1/3, 1/3 each of what's going to drive that closing that gap? I guess I was trying to gauge the size of what's left.
Claire McDonough: Colin, we're not going to provide an update specifically to the bridge that we had commented on. But as I mentioned, the significance in the progress that we've seen to date has really been driven by fixed cost leverage from production ramp and some of the progress in our material cost-down trajectory. So you can extrapolate that to understand those sort of relative reweighting of those three key drivers for us.
Operator: Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Jordan Levy with Truist Securities. Your line is now open.
Henry Roberts: Hi, all. It's Henry on for Jordan here. Just had a quick one around some of the current micro news on EV demand. I just want to get a sense of any small changes in your thinking around the launch of R2, timing, et cetera, due to this? Or do you think the backdrop for EV is, be substantially improved by the time it rolls out in 2026? Thanks.
RJ Scaringe: Ultimately, as we look at, I'd say, broadly beyond even R2, just at the space, I think there is an overreaction to some of the short-term headwinds, short or medium-term headwinds we see between interest rates being at record high levels. And of course, those aren't going to drop down anytime in the next month or two, but this is something that will recover over time, and some of the geopolitical challenges that we have across the world. So if you look at R2 launching in 2026, everything about our R2 in terms of its ability to – and our deep confidence in its ability to capture the essence of our brand. We're enormously excited about the product, but to do it at a price point that's considerably lower than what we have in R1 and at a form factor, a size that makes it sort of fit from an addressable market point of view, fit the largest segment in the United States. We couldn't be more excited and bullish on this product. And we think the timing of it works out beautifully, in terms of the brand buildup that we're driving with R1, and off the back of that to then have a product that is sized physically in terms of its footprint, as well as priced such that it can really capture the hearts and minds of buyers but also give customers a real choice. There's an extreme vacuum of choice we feel in the sort of $45,000 to $50,000 price range for midsize SUVs. There's just not a lot of great options. And as a result, we see very highly concentrated market share with Tesla, but we believe there's a need for alternatives, and those alternatives need to be very robustly developed, with vertically integrated software electronics and deeply seamless user experience, user interface, which is, of course, what we're developing with R2.
Henry Roberts: Awesome. Thanks for that. And then kind of just piggybacking off the software space, could you just update us again on some of the monetization opportunities you all see in the software segment kind of into next year and then kind of longer term?
RJ Scaringe: We've spoken about this before, but we really believe in terms of the large-scale opportunities to monetize, I think the most – the model that we think is going to fit and has shown to fit the most is around autonomy. And as we look at higher levels of autonomy, the ability to charge for that. And there's a variety of ways that can be done, monthly payments, as well as upfront payment for access to a higher level of autonomy. We do think there's been an over there's been over – it's been overestimated how much vehicle manufacturers can charge for every software feature. So the way that we think about it is, the features that have a lot of complexity and require a lot of development, autonomy being a great example of that, some of what we think of – as some of the really interesting immersive user experiences, particularly as you start to think about AR, and the way that the vehicle can interact with its environment. We think those represent opportunities for an incremental charge above and beyond the base platform. But like the idea of charging for heated seats or charging for sort of a binary 1 or 0 like turning a feature on and off, we don't think that, that's going to land well with consumers, and we don't think that that's going to be a sustained model for charging for software. We think it really ties to the much more complex, much more heavy development platforms.
Operator: Thank you. Our last question is from Alex Potter with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open.
Alexander Potter: Perfect. Thanks a lot. I was wondering if you could give us an update on your battery strategy. I know that historically, you've been working in-house, potentially and having your own chemistry, your own cell. You've spoken relatively favorably about LFP. Any changes in your thinking there about what you're doing now and also looking forward to R2?
RJ Scaringe: So this is a space that's rapidly evolving. And as we if we look out over the next decade, one of the things that's become very clear through both the lens of policy, but also through the lens of securing long-term supply, is the upstream supply of some of the raw materials. So lithium hydroxide, lithium carbonate, of course, nickel, thinking also very much and more recently about graphite. And each of these upstream raw materials has different implications around the cell manufacturing itself. So something like graphite, of course, has very closely tied relation to the anode chemistry, whereas, let's say, lithium hydroxide is a little bit more commoditized and easier to integrate into a downstream supply. And so where we've been spending a lot of time is building a very robust strategy around each of the components of the cell and each of the raw materials of the cell from an upstream relationship point of view, and also making sure that those upstream relationships and the way we want to engage with those upstream suppliers integrates with the way we've structured our deals with battery cell suppliers, and in the case of R2, this is really important given the role that IRA is going to play, in terms of driving advantaged pricing with the consumer-facing tax credit and the effect that, that will have in terms of consumer behavior. So we're incredibly focused on upstream supply. I also think that the last 18 months have been a really challenging environment in that, particularly if you think about what happened in 2022 and into the beginning of 2023, where there was, I would say, a lot of bad deals done in the upstream raw material supply, where people are overpaying and inflating the market and it made it hard to do a good deal. We sort of watched some of that play out. And I'd say in the aftermath of some of that exuberance, there's now a lot more rational deals that are on the table in terms of securing some of that upstream supply of raw materials.
Alexander Potter: Great. Okay. That was going to be my next question. So I guess maybe one last one, just a simple one. How many pre-March 1st orders do you still have in the backlog, presumably, there shouldn't be very – many of them left, at what point is that going to be completely cleansed? Thanks.
Claire McDonough: Alex, we'll continue to work through the pre-March 1st preorder base as a whole. And as we've talked about in the past, they'll be feathered in both new orders as well as pre-March 1st orders, especially as we expand our production to include more Dual-Motor units, which weren't available to those pre-March 1st consumers originally, and will introduce Max Pack, and there's a variety of new introductions over the course of 2024 as well. So you'll continue to see both new orders, as well as our pre-March 1st preorders feathered in together.
Operator: Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to RJ Scaringe, for closing remarks.
RJ Scaringe: Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the call today. We've spent the – or the time, over the last quarter, really continue to focus on things we've said, we're going to focus on driving up production volume and achieving better fixed cost leverage, achieving meaningful reductions in our material costs from a bill of materials point of view, working on building out our commercial and go-to-market operations to allow us to, not only continue driving demand, but to continue driving up our ASPs. And importantly, focused on developing our next set of products around the R2 platform, which, as you heard me say, we couldn't be more excited about and really looking forward to showing to the world in the early part of next year. As we now look out and particularly with all the discussion around long-term EV penetration and the timing for EV penetration, I want to just end by saying, we remain deeply convicted around the transition of the entirety of our transportation space, and we're committed to building customers – or building products that our customers absolutely love, and building a brand around those products that continues to resonate across a variety of price points in a variety of form factors, which, of course, the R2 platform will really help deliver on. So with that, thank you, everyone, for joining. Look forward to our next call.
Operator: This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."
5874,TSLA,4,2023,2024-01-24 22:38:03,"Martin Viecha: Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Tesla's Fourth Quarter 2023 Q&A Webcast. My name is Martin Viecha, VP of Investor Relations, and I'm joined today by Elon Musk, Vaibhav Taneja, and a number of other executives. Our Q4 results were announced at about 3.00 pm Central Time in the Update Deck we published at the same link as this webcast. During this call, we will discuss our business outlook and make forward-looking statements. These comments are based on our predictions and expectations as of today. Actual events or results could differ materially due to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those mentioned in our most recent filings with the SEC. During the question-and-answer portion of today's call, please limit yourself to one question and one follow-up. Please use the raise hand button to join the question queue. But before we jump into Q&A, Elon has some opening remarks. Elon?
Elon Musk: Thank you. So the Tesla team did an incredible job in 2023. We achieved record production and deliveries of over 1.8 million vehicles in line with our official guidance. And in Q4, we were producing vehicles at an annualized run rate of almost 2 million cars a year. This is really a phenomenal achievement. Looking at just the Fremont factory alone, we made 560,000 cars. This is a record. In fact, it's the highest output of automotive plants in North America. And people are often surprised that the highest output factory, car factory in North America is in the San Francisco Bay area. It's a little counterintuitive, perhaps. And it's really had an incredibly positive impact on that entire area. What would have been a rundown strip mall is the highest productivity car plant in the Americas. Think about that. It was derelict when we got it, and now it's the most productive plant in this entire part of the world. And it's enriched the community in so many different ways. It's really a gem. So I'm super proud of the people that work there. Model Y became the best-selling vehicle globally, as predicted. The best-selling vehicle of any kind, not just electric vehicles with over 1.2 million units delivered. The energy storage business delivered nearly 15 gigawatt hours of batteries in 2023, compared to 6.5 gigawatt hours the year before. So tremendous year-over-year growth, triple-digits. And yeah, I think we'll continue to see very strong growth in storage, as predicted. I said for many years that the storage business would grow much faster than the car business, and it is doing that. Free cash flow remains strong at $4.4 billion in 2023, in spite of record spending on future projects. So we had record CapEx expenses as well as record R&D. This brings us to 2024. There's a lot to look forward to in 2024. Tesla is currently between two major growth waves. We're focused on making sure that our next growth wave, driven by next-gen vehicle, energy storage, full self-driving, other projects, is executed as well as possible. For full self-driving, we've released Version 12, which is a complete architectural rewrite compared to prior versions. This is end-to-end artificial intelligence. So another bit nets basically photons in and controls out, and it really is quite a profound difference. This is currently just with employees and a few customers, but we will be rolling out to all customers in the U.S. who request full self-driving in the weeks to come. That's over 400,000 vehicles in North America. So this is the first-time AI is being used, not just for object perception, but for path planning and vehicle controls. We replaced 330,000 lines of C++ code with neural nets. It's really quite remarkable. Yeah, sort of, as a side note, I think Tesla is probably the most efficient company in the world for AI inference. Out of necessity, we've actually had to be extremely good at getting the most out of hardware, because Hardware 3 at this point is several years old. So I think we're quite far ahead of any other company in the world in terms of AI and inference efficiency, which is going to be a very important metric in the future in many arenas. So, the new Model 3 is now available globally. So we did an updated Model 3. While the car looks similar, a lot of work has gone into the vehicle to make it better in every way. It is significantly quieter, more refined, better equipped, has longer range and many other improvements, and I recommend taking it for a test drive. If you have not driven a Model 3 in a long time, you should really try the new one. So, steady improvements. And we're very far along on our next-generation low-cost vehicle. This is an earnings call, not a product announcement. So there'll no doubt be many questions that try to ask us about new product, new products coming. But we reserve product announcements for product announcements not earning calls. So -- but we're very excited about this, and this is really going to be profound, not just in its design of the vehicle itself, but in the design of the manufacturing system. This is a revolutionary manufacturing system significantly, far more advanced than any other automotive manufacturing system in the world, by a significant margin. Several years ago, I said, perhaps the most important competitive characteristic of Tesla in the future will be manufacturing technology and you will really see that come to bear with our next-gen vehicle. The first manufacturing location for this will be at our Gigafactory and headquarters in Austin, Texas, and then we'll follow that up with other locations around the world. Probably the factory we'll build in Mexico will be second, and then we'll be looking to identify a third location, perhaps by the end of this year or early next outside of North America. In conclusion, we had a great year with record production, record deliveries, and a strong free cash flow in spite of a very high interest rate environment. And we are focused on exciting new projects that will -- I think, ultimately if we execute on all these things, and it is very hard to do all these things, it's not a sure thing. But I do see a path where Tesla could one day be the most valuable company in the world. I do emphasize that is not an easy path and a very difficult one, but it is now in the set of possible outcomes and previously I would not have thought it is in the set of possible outcomes. And thank you, again to all of our investors, our employees, and our suppliers for a strong year, and looking forward to a great 2024 and years to come. Thank you.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. And our CFO, Vaibhav has some opening remarks as well.
Vaibhav Taneja: Thanks, Martin. Good afternoon, everyone. As Elon mentioned, we had a record year in terms of both production and deliveries for our auto business as well as record deployments in our energy business. This was achieved despite 2023 being a challenging year in terms of higher interest rates and higher inflation. Big thanks to our customer for being with us through this challenging period. I would also like to thank the whole Tesla team for their resolve and dedication throughout. In terms of 2023 financials, we ended the year with over $96 billion of revenue and generated $4.4 billion of free cash flow to end the year with over $29 billion of cash and investments on hand. Our 2023 GAAP net income was impacted by the recognition of one-time non-cash benefit of $5.9 billion from the release of valuation allowance on certain deferred tax assets. This was due to our recent history of sustained profitability and is similar to several other companies who have recently gone through a similar change in their account. Accordingly, starting with Q1, our book tax rate will now be more in line with other companies in the S&P 500. In our vehicle business, we continue to see improvements in our per unit cost despite us being in the early phase of Cybertruck ramp. As a result, our auto gross margin improved sequentially. That said, predicting auto gross margins is extremely challenging since there are many moving parts to this equation, some of which are out of our control like the change in tariffs or local incentives to name a few. While the teams are focused on cost reductions, we are approaching the limits within our current platforms. On the demand front, as promised, we made investments in digital campaigns in 2023. We fully appreciate the importance of customer education as we are still in a customer acquisition phase. Our data suggests that around 90% of our vehicle buyers in 2023 never owned a Tesla before. We are being creative in figuring out ways to bring in new customers and educate them about the benefits of owning a Tesla versus gas-powered vehicles. The key among them being total cost of ownership. This concept is mostly overlooked for just the upfront cost. We will be rigorous in evaluating our campaigns, curating the content, and optimizing spend accordingly to support the overall demand. There are two additional things I would like to mention as it relates to the US market. First, for customers who qualify for the IRA buyer credit, we now offer that as a point-of-sale benefit for Model Y, which means an immediate reduction of $7,500 at the time of purchase to the end customer. Secondly, we continue to offer very attractive lease rates for Model 3 and Y using our Partner Leasing Program. Note that the sales under this program are recognized as upfront revenue and reported within automotive sales. Our energy storage business had another record year with deployments more than doubling and revenues increasing by more than 50%. This business is poised to again surpass our auto business in terms of growth rate in 2024. This has been in the works for quite some time with us laying the foundation a few years back by building our Megafactory in Lathrop. I would like to thank the whole Tesla Energy team for their efforts to make this a reality. Our services and others business also started contributing meaningfully to our results and our fleets -- as our fleet grows. As we expected the fleet-based revenues from supercharging, used cars, and services continue to increase. For 2024, our focus is to continue growing our output, continuing our cost reduction efforts, and increasing investments in our future growth initiatives. Accordingly, we are currently expecting our capital expenditure for 2024 to be in excess of $10 billion. We believe this would be critical in helping us lay the foundation for the next phase of growth. Once again, I would like to thank everybody at Tesla, our investors, and our suppliers for being with us in this journey. We can open it up to questions, Martin.
A - Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go through investor questions. Question number one is from Michael. Given that you moved the start of the next-generation compact vehicle production to Austin, has the timeline improved so that we might see next-generation platform vehicles in 2025?
Elon Musk: I mean, I would certainly say things with they should be taken with a grain of salt, since I am often optimistic. I don't want to blow your minds, but I'm often optimistic regarding time. But our current schedule shows that we will start production towards the end of 2025. So sometime in the second half. That's just what our current schedule says. But there's a lot of new technology like a tremendous amount of new revolutionary manufacturing technology here. The reason I wanted to put this new revolutionary manufacturing line at Giga Texas was because we really need the engineers to be living on the line. This is not sort of off the shelf, just works type of thing. And it's just a lot easier for Tesla engineering to live online if it's in Austin versus elsewhere. So -- but we are currently expecting to start production second half next year. That will be a challenging production ramp. Like, as I can emphasize we'll be sleeping on the line practically. In fact, not practically. We will be. But I am confident that once it is going, it will be head and shoulders above any other manufacturing technology that exists anywhere in the world. It's next level. So it's always difficult to predict what that S-curve of manufacturing looks like. So it always starts off real slow, and then it grows exponentially. So -- and predicting that intermediate S-curve is difficult, so I don't know. It's hard to say what the unit volume would be next year. We're not going to make any predictions on that front, but it does seem quite likely that we will start production next year.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is from Michael again. What has been the barrier to ramping 4680 cells into the multi-million cells per week rate and when do you expect to get there?
Elon Musk: Karn?
Karn Budhiraj: Yeah. First, I just want to allay any concerns regarding 4680 limiting the Cybertruck ramp, because I've seen some people commenting about that. To date, 4680 production is ahead of the ramp with actually weeks of finished cell inventory. And the goal is to keep it that way, not only for Cyber, but for our future vehicle programs. And as Elon said, it is an S-curve here too. It's hard to predict these things, but I'm just describing our goals.
Elon Musk: It's a hard problem.
Karn Budhiraj: Yeah.
Elon Musk: There are entire companies where all they do is make battery cells. That's, like, all they do.
Karn Budhiraj: Indeed, indeed.
Elon Musk: We do a lot of other things, and we got a lot of breakthrough technologies that take time to figure out with 46. It's not just that it's a 46 millimeter diameter by 80 millimeter [Indiscernible] cell. That's just the dimensions. There's tremendous amount of new technology in the cell itself.
Karn Budhiraj: And manufacturing technology.
Elon Musk: Yes, exactly.
Karn Budhiraj: And just regarding what the team was able to do in Q4, Texas successfully swapped line one from the Model Y design of the cell to the Cybertruck design of the cell, which was the 10% cell energy increase I've mentioned before. And as with any major new product introduction, the factory and engineering teams collaborated to ensure quality of the new design and the process changes as their first priority. And now our focus returns to cost and production ramp in Q1. And in terms of what we're doing, we're currently running one production line, one assembly line, using two assembly lines in addition for yield and rate improvement trials, and we have a fourth in commissioning, and four more will be installed starting in Q3 this year. So definitely this is a big year for ramping 4680.
Elon Musk: But we also do want to emphasize that we also expect to ramp orders from our suppliers.
Karn Budhiraj: Yeah.
Elon Musk: So this is not about replacing our suppliers, it's about supplementing our suppliers.
Karn Budhiraj: Yes.
Elon Musk: So we are very appreciative of our suppliers. Panasonic, obviously, is our longest supplier. They're an amazing company. We've got CATL, we've got LG and BYD.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is from Adam. Should retail shareholders be concerned that Elon has stated that he is uncomfortable expanding AI and robotics at Tesla if he doesn't have 25% of voting?
Elon Musk: Yeah, I guess. Let me explain what my concern is here, which is that I see a path to creating an artificial intelligence and robotics juggernaut of truly immense capability and power. And my concern would be, I don't want to control it. But if I have so little influence over the company at that stage that I could sort of be voted out by some sort of random shareholder advisory firm. We've had a lot of challenges with institutional shareholder services, ISS, I call them ISIS, and Glass Lewis, which -- and there's a lot of activists that basically infiltrate those organizations and have strange ideas about what should be done. So I want to have enough to be influential. Like, if we could do a dual-class stock, that would be ideal. I'm not looking for additional economics. I just want to be an effective steward of very powerful technology. And the reason I just sort of roughly picked approximately 25% was that's not so much that I can control the company, even if I go bonkers and if I'm, like, mad, they can throw me out. But it's enough that I have a strong influence. That's what I'm aiming for, is a strong influence, but not control. If there's some way to achieve that that would be great.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question is, what is your expectation for automotive gross margin ex-regulatory credits for the full year?
Vaibhav Taneja: Like, I said in my opening remarks, we're focused on reducing the cost of our vehicles. This is very extensive and involved exercise whereby we look at not just the component cost, but down to the packaging used to get the materials to the production flow. Each element of the cost is scrutinized to optimize further. A few pennies saved at the subcomponent level, whether through engineering redesign or from many other things which I mentioned leads to cost reduction. This is a constant exercise and we just have to chase down every penny possible. We have a strong team which is hyper-focused on this. However, this is a very difficult thing to predict precisely because there are lots of...
Elon Musk: We don't know. We don't have a crystal ball, so it's difficult for us to predict this with precision. If the interest rates come down quickly, I think margins will be good. And if they don't come down quickly, they won't be that good. Yeah. It's always important to remember that the vast majority of people buying a car is about the monthly payment. It's not that people don't want. We have tons of -- we have lots of people who want to buy our car but simply cannot afford it. And as interest rates drop and that monthly payment drops, then they're able to afford it and they buy the car. It's pretty straightforward and there are no tricks around to get around this.
Martin Viecha: Okay. Thank you. The next question is, does the company anticipate a 50% volume CAGR to be realized in either of 2024 or 2025? If not, why not?
Vaibhav Taneja: As we have said in our prior guidance, there will be periods where we won't be growing at the same rate as before. We are between two major growth waves. The first one began with the global expansion of Model 3 and Y, and we believe the next one will be initiated with the next generation platform. In 2024, our volume growth will be lower, as we have said, because we are trying to focus the team on the launch of the next generation vehicle.
Martin Viecha: All right. Thank you very much. The next question is from Michael. When will Tesla start construction on the Giga Nevada expansion and Giga Mexico, and when can we expect each of these to produce their first products such as 4680 cell, Semi, and next-gen vehicles?
Karn Budhiraj: We have recently broken ground for the next phase of Giga Nevada expansion to incorporate Semi and other projects. But as said earlier, as regarding Mexico, we want to first demonstrate success with the next-generation platform in Austin before we start construction. Therefore, we have started the long lead work to get the basics ready and plan to follow our recipe from the 3/Y ramp with Shanghai, where we started with learnings from Fremont and ramp really quickly.
Elon Musk: Yeah, exactly. It's important to emphasize that I mean, Model 3 production was three years of hell, I've said it before, some of the really worst years of my life, frankly. I still have mental scar tissue from those three years, as do many. And then Model Y was somewhat of a variant on Model 3. So a much easier situation. And then we were able to actually do an improved -- slightly improved versions of, in some cases, significantly improved versions of the Model Y production line in Shanghai and Berlin. And that's the right, I think the sensible way to go about things is kind of figure out the core technology of the manufacturing line and then replicate it with improvements throughout the world.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question from Michael is, has there been any progress made with an FSD licensing agreement with another company?
Elon Musk: I really think lots of car companies should be asking for FSD licenses. And we've had some tentative conversations, but I think they don't believe it's real quite yet. I think that will become obvious probably this year. And I do want to emphasize that if I were CEO of another car company, I would definitely be calling Tesla and asking to license Tesla full self-driving technology. It's definitely the smart move.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question from Siddharth. What is the timeline for Optimus first production off volume production line and what are the barriers to getting there?
Elon Musk: Optimus, obviously, is a very new product, an extremely revolutionary product, and something that I think has the potential to potential to far exceed the value of everything else that Tesla combined. When you think of an economy, economy is productivity per capita times capita. But what if there's no limit to capita? There's no limit to the economy. And the technologies that we've -- AI technologies that we've developed for the car translate quite well to a humanoid robot because the car is just a robot on four wheels. Tesla is arguably already the biggest robot maker in the world. It's just a four-wheeled robot. So Optimus is a humanoid robot with arms and legs. It's by far the most sophisticated humanoid robot that's being developed anywhere in the world. I think we've got a good chance of shipping some number of Optimus units next year. But like I said, this is a brand new product. A lot of uncertainty -- when you have -- when there's a lot of uncertainty in your uncharted territory, it's obviously impossible to make a precise prediction. But we will be updating the public with progress on Optimus every few months, and you can see that it's advancing very quickly. I was just in the Optimus lab, actually, until late last night, like red night or something, finally left the Optimus lab. The team's doing amazing work. That's obviously a case where we want to make sure that Optimus is safe, especially at scale, and that there's no -- it should be impossible for any centralized control to upload malware to a humanoid robot. So we're going to want to pull then localized shut off that cannot be updated from a central server. That's the case where we really have to give extreme thought to safety. But like I said, I do think it has the potential to be the most valuable product of any kind ever, by far.
Karn Budhiraj: Just to comment on the barrier, I think the barrier, and we've talked about this, is like getting it to actually do something useful. Like, we can get it to walk around, we can get it do things, but it's like that utility part.
Elon Musk: We can already do some useful things.
Karn Budhiraj: But like, to making millions of these things, it's like utility. Got to get the utility of it.
Elon Musk: Yeah. A smart robot that can do -- that's capable of doing generalized tasks is what it will be in terms of doing moderately specialized tasks. Well, it can already do that. It'll just get better through the course of the year. As we improve the technology in the car, we improve the technology in Optimus at the same time. It runs the same AI inference computer that's on the car. Same training technology. I mean, we're really building the future. I mean, the Optimus lab looks like the set of Westworld. Admittedly, that was not a super utopian situation.
Karn Budhiraj: Yeah. Not the best reference.
Elon Musk: Yeah. The creators of Westworld, Jonathan Nolan, Lisa Joy Nolan, friends, old friends of mine, actually. And I invited them to come see the lab. I think they'll come see it, hopefully soon. It's pretty wild, especially the sort of subsystem test stands where you've just got like one leg on a test stand, just doing repetitive exercises and one arm on a test stand. Pretty wild. Yeah.
Karn Budhiraj: We're not entering Westworld anytime soon.
Elon Musk: Right. You take safety very, very seriously.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question from Nermin is, how many Cybertruck orders are in the queue and when do you anticipate you will be able to fulfill existing orders?
Karn Budhiraj: First of all, I want to thank all the Cybertruck reservation holders for their patience. The reservation to order conversion rates so far has been very, very encouraging. If the trend continues as it very likely to be, we will soon sold out all the builds in 2024. And also, we have new orders come in after the launch. The auto numbers keep growing. So we're now all hands on deck, focused on ramping so we can fulfill all the demands in a reduced wait time.
Elon Musk: Yeah. It's important to emphasize that this is very much a production-constrained situation, not a demand-constrained situation. And obviously, we could dramatically raise the price, but that doesn't feel right to us to sort of gouge people for early delivery. So -- but really, the demand is off the hook. As long as the price is affordable, I mean, I see us ultimately delivering on the order of 0.25 million, something like 0.25 million Cybertrucks a year in North America, maybe more. But give or take roughly on that time frame, and it sure is a head-turner.
Vaibhav Taneja: Definitely is. Anywhere you go, people look at you, they give you thumbs up.
Elon Musk: Yeah. It's like finally, the future. Looks like the future. It's just -- for the other trucks on the road there, which -- there's some very good trucks on the road, but if you were to switch out the brand name, you wouldn't hardly know which company made them, but you definitely would know the Cybertruck. That's our best product ever.
Martin Viecha: All right. Thank you. The next question is, can we get Tesla Energy volumes reported in the production and delivery release?
Karn Budhiraj: Yeah. We will strive to do so starting from this quarter. And just a brief update from the business perspective. Megapack continues to see strong demand signals globally, driving consistent growth trajectory through '24 and '25. We want to thank all of our partners who've put their trust in the Megapack team to execute on critical infrastructure around the world. And I would like to personally thank the Megapack engineering and production teams for their strong 2023 execution. Lathrop continues to ramp through 2024 with the operation of a second final assembly line to double capacity from 20 gigawatt to 40 gigawatt hours by the end of the year.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. And the last investor question is from Siddharth, what are the preliminary results and return on investment of your ads and education campaign? Given that many people still lack awareness that Tesla average price is less than the average non-luxury car price of $45,000, will you expand educational ads?
Unidentified Company Representative: As Elon mentioned, the ultimate solution to increase EV adoption is really address the affordability issue. But at the same time, we do aware there's awareness issue as well. So in Q4, we ran a series of digital campaigns, very targeted digital campaigns across different geos and different channel. The target of these tests is really just to drive awareness and ultimately measure the return of investment on those digital channels. The messaging we're driving has really focused on our product and also try to address some of the misconception of the EV, such as safety, affordability. And one particular awareness campaign we run in Texas will reach the audience, about 10 million unique viewers, and generated close to 0.5 million visits to our website. A large number of these viewers are first-time visitors to our website. The traffic through these digital channels actually behaved very similar to those organic traffic come to our website. So going forward, we're just going to keep exploring different channels and doing our trials to get a better understanding of this effectiveness of these digital campaigns.
Vaibhav Taneja: But I would also like to caution that we'll be very careful that we don't want to overspend on this side. We want to make sure people are aware. But that's where we'll keep tweaking our methodology about how and where we spend the money. Because we understand the importance of increasing awareness, but at the same token, we don't want to spend a lot of money on just creating awareness.
Elon Musk: Yeah. I mean, there are some geographies where our market share is remarkably low. Like Japan, for example. Now, we also need to make sure that we have superchargers in the right locations and the service centers are there, and the product works well in Japan. But Japan is the third largest car market in the world of any country, and we should at least have a market share proportionate to, say, other non-Japanese car makers like Mercedes or BMW, which we do not currently have. So I think that's a case -- when I talk to friends of mine in Japan, they're like -- there is quite a lack of awareness of Tesla. So that's a case where we definitely need to increase awareness in countries and regions where there is, yeah, not that much awareness.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to analyst questions. The first question comes from Pierre Ferragu from New Street Research. Pierre, go ahead, please. Feel free to unmute. Pierre, can you hear us?
Pierre Ferragu: Okay. Wow. It's really tough to find the unmute button on Team's guide. I'm sorry for being late. So, yes, my question would on the cost reduction, you've talked about it already a lot. And if I look at it, over the last like, five, six quarters, on average, the COGS per car has been coming down, like, more than 2% sequentially, on average. So that means you are, like, on a trajectory of COGS per car going down 10% a year. So that's probably, like, unheard of in the auto industry. I don't think any car manufacturer ever achieved that. But that's very mundane, and it's a good performance, but it's a very normal performance in a lot of other manufacturing industry, like microelectronics or consumer electronics. And so I'd love to hear your thoughts about whether you consider yourself closer to the latter to, like, a microeconomics business where you have this ability to actually always improve costs. You have more control on how things are pulled together into your cars, and you see yourself sustainably taking costs down with that kind of pace or do you think your ability to take down cost is actually going to become more like in line with the rest in the industry over time?
Vaibhav Taneja: Yeah. I think I covered this in a pretty lengthy detail, even in my opening remarks and in a previous question. But to just further clarify, we are constantly looking for what we can do to reduce cost. Like I said, it's a game of pennies. We've talked about it before as well. And the team is constantly going and checking, where can we reduce the cost further. And do I believe that we will have the same pace which you've seen over the past few years? Probably not, because remember, we were coming out with a period wherein commodity prices were rising, so then we did see benefits coming from that. So those are more or less taken care of. But there is more which we're still chasing. And I would say a big kudos goes to the team out here at Tesla, both the engineering team as well as the supply chain team, because every time we give them a challenge, they go gangbusters to try and figure out whatever they can to take out further cost. But yes, I would -- like I said, I would want to caution that do not project the previous cost reduction at the same pace completely in the future, because with our current platform, we are getting to a place wherein there are limitations.
Karn Budhiraj: Yeah. The increased scale also sort of helps us there. As we introduce new products, we have the opportunity to go renegotiate existing suppliers for better pricing. We're looking at every penny, like Vaibhav and Elon mentioned. Just to give you an example, our inbound logistics cost has come down by 22% year-over-year. And this is because of optimization on using returnable packaging as opposed to cardboard, which is even better for the environment, optimizing trucking routes, negotiating better pricing with shipping companies, with trucking companies, going with full truckloads and just doing that, sort of. The bigger we become, the more we put thought into these things and the more efficient we become as a result of it. So those work streams are going to continue.
Unidentified Company Representative: And we are also getting into the tiers of supply chain to see if there are opportunities, getting into the tier 2, tier 3, tier 4 levels, and then negotiate those pricing as well to get more efficiency out of the system.
Karn Budhiraj: And then on the design side, we're not static, right, like, especially in areas where the technology is still improving rapidly. Power electronics is a great example. We continue to bring improvements there that are like fundamentals, sort of driven from the device up, that result in cost reductions, generation over generation. And they don't only go into the new vehicles, they come to the old vehicles as well. So that's closer to what you were talking about with the microelectronic space. Some of that exists in the vehicle.
Lars Moravy: Yeah. Certainly our car is more computer than car in many ways and has a lot of new tech over the last 100 years of automotive production that everyone's trying to scrape pennies from.
Elon Musk: We have a crazy amount of compute in our cars compared to anyone else. It's like orders of magnitude.
Karn Budhiraj: And we get to ride that down, right?
Elon Musk: 1,000 times more. Some nutty number.
Karn Budhiraj: I mean, if I just look at the main microcontroller that makes the motor truck go, for example, when I think about what it costs when we stuck it in a roadster in 2006, it costs now. There's no comparison. So we've definitely been riding that electronics cost wave.
Elon Musk: Yeah.
Lars Moravy: And then even on the like non -- what you call traditional vehicle side, we do things that no other automakers do to bring cost down through breaking down the way structures are built and the way we put our cars together. And I think that mindset that we have is very much closer to the microprocessor or power electronics industry than the automotive industry.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Pierre, do you have a follow-up?
Pierre Ferragu: Great. Yes, a quick one. You mentioned this phase in which you are between two big growth periods. I'd love to hear you about what you consider the size of your addressable market. With the portfolio you have today, like the three, the Y, the X, and the S, what's your estimate of your addressable market? You're shipping like, probably about like a 2 million unit run rate today and given the price points of these cars, what kind of market share of what you address with these cars do you think you've already achieved today?
Elon Musk: I don't know, if anybody -- I actually don't think we have a firm idea of this. That's hard to say exactly.
Vaibhav Taneja: Yeah. This -- I won't say there's -- I mean, one way to think about it is look at the automotive industry as well. EVs still contribute a very small market share. So, yes, our goal is to try and take as much market share out of that pie. But do I have a specific number to give you? I don't think we can say that with certainty.
Andrew Baglino: And it's a growing pie as well.
Vaibhav Taneja: Exactly
Andrew Baglino: It's like its 9% today, but it could be 20% in a couple of years or in the future.
Elon Musk: Yeah.
Andrew Baglino: Certainly, like the way we've looked at it, and we've always said this, it's not about how many EVs we sell. It's how many great cars you can sell, how many vehicles you can sell. And that market is 100 million a year, and we're barely 2% of that. I still think there's 98% more to get.
Elon Musk: I mean, it's worth noting that if you look at, say, the average selling price of the other top-selling vehicles in the world, they are much lower priced than a Model Y.
Andrew Baglino: Yeah.
Elon Musk: So like Toyota RAV4.
Andrew Baglino: Corolla.
Elon Musk: Corolla, Honda Civic, that kind of thing. They're much lower priced than ours. So people are really stretching their wallets to be able to afford a Tesla. It's quite a difficult thing for them to do, and remarkable that it's the best-selling car in unit volume, despite being much more expensive than other high-volume cars.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. Let's go to the next analyst. The next question comes from Adam Jonas from Morgan Stanley.
Adam Jonas: Hey, everybody. So I can't wait to see the Optimus lab. I'm sure everybody on this call feels the same way. Your last AI Day, Elon, was September 2022. Can we expect a Tesla AI Day this year? It seems like a lot has changed in that realm. And is this year the time?
Elon Musk: Yeah, it's a good question. We have found that when we do these AI Days, some of our competitors literally look at what we do on a frame-by-frame basis.
Adam Jonas: They do.
Elon Musk: And then we find these things being copied.
Karn Budhiraj: Same thing with Battery Day.
Elon Musk: Same thing with Battery Day. So we have to be a little cautious about revealing the exact recipe of the secret sauce. But I think some kind of update would be good to do. I'll talk it over with the team, and yeah, I think we might do something later this year. Our main goal with these AI Day things is recruiting and to sort of change the perception of Tesla as people thinking of Tesla as a car company when they should be thinking of Tesla as an AI robotics company.
Adam Jonas: Maybe as a follow-up. Elon, I'd love your thoughts on the topic of China-based OEMs expanding into Western markets. As the China market kind of gets saturated and there's a tremendous growth in the supply, how much success should Tesla investors allow for this competition to achieve in Western markets? And can you envision a scenario where Tesla could partner with a Chinese OEM to help accelerate sustainable transport in markets like Europe and the United States? Thanks.
Elon Musk: Well, our observation is generally that the Chinese car companies are the most competitive car companies in the world. So I think they will have significant success outside of China depending on what kind of tariffs or trade barriers are established. Frankly, I think if there are not trade barriers established, they will pretty much demolish most other car companies in the world. So they're extremely good. We don't see an obvious opportunity to partner. Certainly, we're happy to, except on the supercharger front. We're obviously happy to give any electric car company access to our supercharger network. We're also happy to license full self-driving, perhaps license other technologies, and anything that could be helpful in advancing the sustainable energy revolution.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. And the next question comes from Dan Levy from Barclays.
Dan Levy: Hi. Good evening. Thank you for taking the questions. First, I'm wondering if you can just walk through some of the gating factors required to unlock your next-gen platform. You talked about a number of cost initiatives back at the Investor Day a year ago, things in manufacturing and powertrain. Maybe you can just give us a sense of where these initiatives stand. And do you believe -- we know that there's a number of new features and technologies in Cybertruck, things like 48 volts architecture, really employing your 4680 batteries. To what extent do you think Cybertruck is really a proving ground for the next-gen platform and is really going to be a gating factor to unlocking the cost reductions needed for the next-gen platform?
Lars Moravy: Yeah, I don't think that anything on Cybertruck should be considered gating for the next-gen platform. We're obviously doing a lot of manufacturing innovation, as Elon said, for a next-generation vehicle. When you do something at that scale, you have to prove it out. You don't just throw it on the line and just build it. So we're going through those validation phases for all those new manufacturing technologies now. Sure, 48 volts was definitely something we wanted to carry forward, and it's something we hope the industry adopts as well. We're also open to partnering.
Elon Musk: Yeah. 48 volts.
Lars Moravy: On that if everyone wants to do that.
Elon Musk: Certainly. Man, the people that really know that this is like the inside baseball thing. But man, 48, it's so high time that the water industry moved from the 12 -- the random number of 12 volts to 48 volts.
Lars Moravy: Random number of 48 volts.
Elon Musk: Yeah. Well, it's much less random.
Lars Moravy: Slightly less random based on human injury, but...
Elon Musk: I mean dramatically reduces the amount of copper you need in the vehicle and also moving to sort of higher bandwidth communications, sort of ethernet level communications versus CAN Bus, which is pretty...
Lars Moravy: Pretty slow.
Elon Musk: Pretty slow. So it's really just bringing cars to...
Lars Moravy: The 21st century.
Elon Musk: Yeah, pretty much.
Lars Moravy: So, certainly like...
Elon Musk: It's not exact -- it's like normal for a laptop. Yeah.
Lars Moravy: Certainly bringing that like is an evolution in our architectures of vehicles, but it's not gating by any means. The gating work is just to finish the design and manufacturing of the car, test them out and get them going.
Karn Budhiraj: Yeah, programs and execution mode, right?
Lars Moravy: Yeah.
Karn Budhiraj: So it's talking about like, tooling lead time, manufacturing equipment lead time, factory lead time, and executing those programs.
Elon Musk: There's a lot of specialized machines that make the machine for a next-gen vehicle. So these are not machines you can just order from anyone. You have to design a machine that has never existed to build a car in a way that has never existed.
Karn Budhiraj: Yeah. So you don't just have like a design validation phase, but you have an equipment design validation phase as well.
Elon Musk: It does make it very hard to copy us because you have to copy the machine that makes the machine that makes the machine.
Lars Moravy: Talk about tiers.
Elon Musk: Yeah, exactly. Manufacturing exception. So I do think it's quite a powerful sustainable advantage because there just is no place to go to order the machines that make our next-gen car that don't exist.
Dan Levy: Great. Thank you. As a follow-up, your release does not mention Dojo. So if you could just provide us an update on where Dojo stands and at what point you expect Dojo to be a resource in improving FSD or do you think that you now have sufficient supply of Nvidia GPUs needed for the training of the system?
Elon Musk: I mean, the AI hardware question is, that is a deep one. So we're obviously hedging our bets here with significant orders of Nvidia GPUs. Or GPU is the wrong word. There really needs to be -- there's no -- it doesn't -- you can't produce graphics, so that's what. It's not a graphics processing unit. Neural net processing unit or something like that. Yeah. GPU is a funny word, like Vestigial. A lot of our progress in self-driving is training limited, something that's important with training, it's much like a human. The more effort you put into training, the less effort you need in inference. So just like a person, if you train in a subject, sort of classic 10,000 hours, the less mental effort it takes to do something. If you remember when you first started to drive, how much of your mental capacity it took to drive. It was -- you had to be focused completely on driving. Then after you've been driving for many years, it only takes a little bit of your mind to drive and you can think about other things and still drive safely. So the more training you do, the more efficient it is at the inference level. So we do need a lot of training. And we're pursuing the dual path of Nvidia and Dojo. But I would think of Dojo as a long shot. It's a long shot worth taking because the payoff is potentially very high. But it's not something that is a high probability. It's not like a sure thing at all. It's a high-risk, high-payoff program. Dojo is working, and it is doing training jobs, and we are scaling it up, and we have plans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2, Dojo 3, and whatnot. So I think it's got potential, but I can't emphasize enough. High risk, high payoff. So I think it still makes sense given the -- even if it's a low probability of success -- I'm laboring the subject. It's a very interesting program. It has the potential for something special. There's also our inference hardware in the car. So we're now on what's called Hardware 4, but it's actually Version 2 of the Tesla-designed AI inference chip. And we're about to complete design of -- the terminology is a bit confusing. We're about to complete design of Hardware 5, which is actually Version 3 of the Tesla-designed chip. Because the Version 1 was Mobileye, Version 2 was Nvidia, and then Version 3 was Tesla. And we're making gigantic improvements from Hardware 3 to Hardware 4 to Hardware 5. I mean, there's a potentially interesting play where when cars are not in use in the future that the in-car computer can do generalized AI tasks, can run a sort of GPT-4 or GPT-3 or something like that. If you've got tens of millions of vehicles out there, even in a robotaxi scenario where they're in heavy use, maybe they're used 50 out of 168 hours, that still leaves well over 100 hours of time available -- of compute hours. It's possible with the right architectural decisions that Tesla may in the future have more compute than everyone else combined.
Martin Viecha: Thank you. The next question comes from Colin Langan from Wells Fargo.
Colin Langan: Great. Thanks for taking my questions. As we're thinking about going into 2024, the press release talks about hitting 36,000 or slightly above in Q4. And the comments in the release talk about approaching the natural limits. And it sounds like you're continuing to try to whittle that away, but that sort of implies there's not much left. In addition, you have the hourly wage increase. I guess we'll add to that into next year. And I thought you said raw material costs are kind or -- that benefit is sort of almost played out. So is there an opportunity to continue to go below the 36,000, or should we kind of be modeling that it kind of stays at this level into '24?
Vaibhav Taneja: We are definitely aware of the cost increases which are coming through because of the wage increases. But like I said, we keep looking at other cost opportunities and try and figure out where else can we cut down. So there is definitely more opportunity to bring down costs further. I won't specifically guide to a number which we will try and get to, but there's definitely more opportunity there.
Andrew Baglino: Yeah. We're chasing lots of cost opportunities on the design side still for 2024, north of eight figures is what we're just in my organization, and Lars has got a bunch. And then from a commodities perspective, it's such a long cycle time through the whole material supply chain that even with what we've already seen to this point...
Vaibhav Taneja: There's more to come.
Andrew Baglino: There's more to come on commodities reductions.
Lars Moravy: And there's still some tailwind left on the commodities.
Andrew Baglino: That's what I mean.
Lars Moravy: Aluminum and steel.
Andrew Baglino: Yeah and battery material.
Elon Musk: It boggles my mind to think that if we make a 1% improvement in costs, that's $1 billion. So it's like, on average, if we reduce the cost by one penny, $1 billion.
Andrew Baglino: What?
Elon Musk: And we started off that long ago that we were only making like 10 cars a week. And yeah, so where does it lead ultimately? With good execution, like I said, it's not a slam dunk, but if we execute very well, I think Tesla could be the most valuable company in the world.
Martin Viecha: Thank you, Colin. Do you have a follow-up question?
Colin Langan: Yeah. Just a quick follow-up. In the commentary, you mentioned the taxes would go to the S&P 500 level. I think you've been trending slightly below 10%. S&P, I think, is typically 25%-ish. Is that going to -- should we expect that to jump right up next year when we're modeling next year or would it be like a gradual change over the next few years and any cash impact from that tax change as well that we should be considering?
Vaibhav Taneja: Yeah. So there's no impact on cash taxes from the release of the valuation amounts, which I spoke about. What it does is, it's how you account for taxes on your books? So it's basically an accounting change wherein there are certain jurisdictions because we had enough NOLs, etc., wherein we didn't have to accrue book taxes. Now that the valuation allowance has been released and we have recognized deferred tax assets on the books, that means your tax rate immediately goes up.
Martin Viecha: Okay. I think that's all the time we have for today. Thank you so much for all of your questions, and we'll speak to you again in three months. Thank you. Bye-bye.
Elon Musk: Thank you."
